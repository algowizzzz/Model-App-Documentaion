1.1. Purpose of the Model

The primary purpose of this model is to provide a comprehensive risk calculation system for assessing and reporting on the risk profile of a given portfolio or set of financial instruments. The model is designed to address the business need for accurate and granular risk analysis, which is critical for effective risk management, regulatory reporting, and strategic decision-making.

The key objectives of this model are:

1. **Risk Factor Calculation**: The model is responsible for calculating the individual risk factors that contribute to the overall risk profile. This includes factors such as market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk, among others. The model handles the complex logic of combining multiple risk factors and producing both detailed and summary risk assessments.

2. **Risk Aggregation and Reporting**: The model aggregates the individual risk factors into a total risk score, providing a high-level view of the overall risk exposure. Additionally, the model breaks down the risk by category, enabling users to understand the relative contribution of different risk types to the total risk. This comprehensive risk reporting is essential for regulatory compliance, internal risk management, and informing business decisions.

3. **Regulatory Capital Calculation**: A key use case for this model is the calculation of regulatory capital requirements. The risk scores and breakdowns generated by the model are intended to be used as inputs for regulatory capital reporting, ensuring that the organization maintains sufficient capital to cover its risk exposures and meet regulatory standards.

4. **Risk-Informed Decision-Making**: The model's outputs, including the total risk score, risk breakdown, and status (high-risk or low-risk), are designed to inform and support various business decisions. This includes portfolio optimization, risk mitigation strategies, and resource allocation, among other risk management and strategic planning activities.

By providing a robust and flexible risk calculation system, this model serves as a critical component within the broader risk management framework of the organization. Its outputs are intended to be consumed by risk managers, compliance teams, and senior decision-makers to ensure that the organization's risk profile is well-understood and appropriately managed.
