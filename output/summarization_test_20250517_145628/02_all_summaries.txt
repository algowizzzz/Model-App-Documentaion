- Logging: The file uses `print` statements to log the initialization of the `GBMProcess` instance and the successful generation of price paths.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
- Assumptions:
    - The input parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta) are valid and within reasonable ranges for the GBM process.
    - The time delta is specified in years, and the drift and volatility parameters are annualized.
- Limitations:
    - The GBM process assumes constant drift and volatility over time, which may not accurately reflect real-world asset price dynamics.
    - The implementation does not account for potential adjustments or modifications to the GBM process, such as incorporating jumps or stochastic volatility.
    - The file does not include any functionality for visualizing or analyzing the generated price paths.

File: financial_instruments/equity_trs.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to represent and value an Equity Total Return Swap (TRS) financial instrument.
   - Its specific role is to provide a self-contained class for modeling and calculating the mark-to-market (MtM) and exposure values of an Equity TRS contract, which is likely a component of a larger financial risk management or pricing system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **Class: EquityTRS**
     - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the representation and valuation of an Equity Total Return Swap contract.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes the contract details (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Calculates the MtM values based on current underlying price paths.
       - Calculates the exposure values from the MtM values.
     - **Inputs:**
       - Trade details dictionary (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Current underlying price paths (numpy array).
     - **Outputs:**
       - MtM values (numpy array).
       - Exposure values (numpy array).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The core algorithm implemented in this file is the calculation of the MtM and exposure values for an Equity TRS contract.
   - The MtM calculation is based on the change in the underlying equity price relative to the initial price at inception, multiplied by the notional amount. The sign of the MtM is adjusted based on whether the trade type is "receive_equity_return" or "pay_equity_return".
   - The exposure calculation simply takes the maximum of 0 and the MtM values, assuming positive MtM means the counterparty owes the holder.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure used is a dictionary to store the trade details (notional, initial price, trade type).
   - Numpy arrays are used to represent the current underlying price paths and to store the calculated MtM and exposure values.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** numpy (for numerical operations and array manipulation).

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `__init__` method of the EquityTRS class performs a validation check on the `trade_type` input, raising a ValueError if it is not one of the expected values ("receive_equity_return" or "pay_equity_return").
   - The file does not implement any explicit logging functionality.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - The code assumes that the funding leg (fixed or floating rate payments) of the TRS is netted against the equity leg at each valuation date, focusing solely on the change in equity value.
   - The exposure calculation assumes that positive MtM values indicate that the counterparty owes the holder, which may not hold true in all cases or under different exposure calculation methodologies.
   - The implementation does not consider any potential adjustments or additional calculations that may be required for specific contract terms or market conventions.
   - The code does not handle any potential exceptions or edge cases related to the input data (e.g., negative notional, invalid price paths).

File: pfe_calculation/pfe_computer.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to provide a class for calculating the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) at a given quantile from a set of exposure paths.
   - This file appears to be a standalone component responsible for a specific calculation step within a broader risk management or exposure modeling system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **PFEQuantileCalculator (Class):**
     - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the logic for calculating the PFE profile at a specified quantile.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes with a quantile value (e.g., 0.95 for 95th percentile).
       - Calculates the PFE profile by taking the specified quantile of positive exposures across paths at each time step.
     - **Inputs:** A 2D NumPy array representing exposure paths, with shape (num_time_steps + 1, num_paths).
     - **Outputs:** A 1D NumPy array representing the PFE profile over time, with shape (num_time_steps + 1,).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The core algorithm implemented in this file is the calculation of the PFE profile at a given quantile using NumPy's `np.percentile` function.
   - The calculation is performed across exposure paths (axis=1) at each time step, taking the specified quantile of positive exposure values.
   - The resulting PFE profile is ensured to be non-negative by applying `np.maximum(0, pfe_profile)`.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure used is a 2D NumPy array representing exposure paths, with shape (num_time_steps + 1, num_paths).
   - The output PFE profile is represented as a 1D NumPy array with shape (num_time_steps + 1,).

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy (for array operations and percentile calculation).

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `__init__` method of the `PFEQuantileCalculator` class raises a `ValueError` if the provided quantile is not between 0 and 1 (exclusive).
   - The `calculate_pfe_profile` method raises a `ValueError` if the input `exposure_paths` is not a 2D array.
   - The file does not implement any explicit logging functionality.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - The code assumes that the input `exposure_paths` array has a specific shape: (num_time_steps + 1, num_paths), where the first row represents exposures at time t=0 (usually 0).
   - The code assumes that the exposure values are non-negative, as it takes the quantile of positive exposures across paths.
   - The implementation does not handle any potential edge cases or special scenarios beyond the basic calculation of the PFE profile from exposure paths.

File: pfe_calculation/exposure_aggregator.py

**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
The primary purpose of this file is to provide a class for aggregating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades. It serves as a component within a broader system or model for calculating and analyzing counterparty credit risk.

**2. Key Components and Functionality:**

- **TradeAggregator Class:**
    - **Purpose:** Manages the aggregation of PFE profiles across multiple trades.
    - **Key Operations:**
        - Stores individual trade PFE profiles in a dictionary.
        - Provides a method to retrieve all stored individual PFE profiles.
        - Implements a simple summation method to aggregate PFE profiles across trades.
    - **Inputs:**
        - `trade_id` (str): Unique identifier for a trade.
        - `pfe_profile` (numpy.ndarray): PFE profile for a specific trade.
    - **Outputs:**
        - `all_trade_pfe_profiles` (dict): Dictionary containing individual PFE profiles for each trade.
        - `aggregated_pfe_profile` (numpy.ndarray): Aggregated PFE profile across all trades (using the simple summation method).

**3. Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
The core algorithm implemented in this file is the `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method of the `TradeAggregator` class. This method performs a simple summation of the PFE profiles across all trades by summing the PFE values at each time step. However, the method acknowledges that this approach is generally not how portfolio PFE is calculated due to netting effects, and it serves as a basic example rather than a production-ready implementation.

**4. Data Structures:**
The primary data structure used in this file is a dictionary (`all_trade_pfe_profiles`) to store individual PFE profiles for each trade, where the trade ID is the key, and the corresponding PFE profile (a numpy array) is the value.

**5. Dependencies:**

- **Internal:** None (assuming this is a standalone file).
- **External:**
    - `numpy`: Used for array operations and calculations on PFE profiles.

**6. Error Handling and Logging:**
- Error Handling:
    - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method checks if the PFE profiles have different lengths and raises a `ValueError` if they do, as summing arrays of different lengths is not allowed.
- Logging:
    - The file uses `print` statements to log various events, such as the initialization of the `TradeAggregator` class, the addition of a new PFE profile, and the calculation of the aggregated PFE profile.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
- Assumptions:
    - The input PFE profiles are provided as numpy arrays.
    - The PFE profiles for different trades have the same length (i.e., the same number of time steps).
- Limitations:
    - The simple summation method implemented in `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` is acknowledged as a basic example and not a production-ready implementation for calculating portfolio PFE due to the lack of netting effects consideration.
    - The file does not implement more complex aggregation methods, such as netting, which are typically required for accurate portfolio PFE calculation.
