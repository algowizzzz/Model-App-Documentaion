# Monte Carlo PFE Calculator for Equity TRS - File Summary

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
    - The primary purpose of this file is to provide an overview and documentation for a project that calculates Potential Future Exposure (PFE) for a portfolio of Equity Total Return Swaps (TRS) using Monte Carlo simulation.
    - This file serves as the main entry point and documentation for the entire project, outlining its structure, workflow, and components. It does not contain any executable code but rather serves as a guide for understanding and navigating the project.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
    - This file does not contain any classes, functions, or methods. It is a documentation file in Markdown format.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
    - This file does not implement any core algorithms or business logic directly. It describes the overall workflow and high-level steps involved in the PFE calculation process.

4. **Data Structures:**
    - This file does not define or manipulate any specific data structures.

5. **Dependencies:**
    - **Internal:** This file references the following internal directories and modules:
        - `config/`: Contains JSON files for trade data, market data, and simulation parameters.
        - `data_management/`: Modules for loading and managing input data.
        - `financial_instruments/`: Modules for defining and valuing financial instruments (e.g., Equity TRS).
        - `pfe_calculation/`: Modules for calculating exposures and aggregating PFE.
        - `reporting/`: Modules for writing output results.
        - `simulation_engine/`: Modules for the Monte Carlo simulation and underlying stochastic processes (GBM).
        - `main_pfe_runner.py`: The main script to execute the PFE calculation.
    - **External:** This file does not explicitly mention any external libraries or packages.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
    - This file does not contain any error handling or logging mechanisms, as it is a documentation file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
    - This file does not make any specific assumptions or have inherent limitations, as it is a documentation file. However, it outlines the overall assumptions and limitations of the project, such as:
        - The underlying equity prices are modeled using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).
        - The project focuses on calculating PFE for Equity Total Return Swaps (TRS).
        - The project assumes the availability of trade data, market data, and simulation parameters in JSON format.
        - The project assumes the ability to generate Monte Carlo simulations and value financial instruments (Equity TRS) based on simulated price paths.
