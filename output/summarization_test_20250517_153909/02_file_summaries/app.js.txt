**SUMMARY:**

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - This file serves as a test JavaScript file to verify the handling of non-Python files within the codebase.
   - Its primary role is likely for testing and demonstration purposes, as it does not appear to be a core component of a larger model or system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **TestClass**
     - **Purpose:** A class that holds a value and provides a method to double it.
     - **Key Operations:** The `doubleValue` method doubles the input number.
     - **Inputs:** The constructor takes a `value` parameter, and the `doubleValue` method takes a `number` parameter `x`.
     - **Outputs:** The `doubleValue` method returns the doubled value of the input number.
   - **testFunction**
     - **Purpose:** A function that concatenates two strings.
     - **Key Operations:** Combines two input strings using template literals.
     - **Inputs:** The function takes two parameters: `param1` (required) and `param2` (optional, with a default value of "default").
     - **Outputs:** Returns a string that concatenates `param1` and `param2` with a hyphen in between.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - This file does not appear to implement any complex algorithms or significant business logic. Its purpose is primarily for testing and demonstration.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - No significant internal data structures are used or manipulated within this file.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** None.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - No explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities are implemented in this file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - **Assumptions:**
     - The `doubleValue` method assumes that the input `x` is a valid number.
     - The `testFunction` assumes that `param1` is a valid string. If `param2` is not provided, it defaults to the string "default".
   - **Limitations:**
     - The file does not include any error handling or input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if invalid inputs are provided.
     - The functionality provided by this file is minimal and serves primarily for testing and demonstration purposes.
