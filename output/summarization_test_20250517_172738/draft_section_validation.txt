5. Model Validation

This section provides an overview of the model validation process, activities, and key findings for the risk calculation model implemented in the `complex_module.py` file.

5.1. Validation Framework Overview
The model validation process for this risk calculation system is governed by the bank's independent model validation framework. This framework ensures that the model is thoroughly evaluated for its conceptual soundness, implementation accuracy, and ongoing performance. The validation is conducted by a dedicated team of model validation experts who are independent from the model development and implementation teams.

The validation process involves the following key activities:

- Backtesting: Evaluating the model's historical performance and accuracy against actual observed outcomes.
- Benchmarking: Comparing the model's results against alternative models or industry standards to assess its relative performance.
- Sensitivity and Stress Testing: Analyzing the model's behavior under various input conditions, parameter changes, and extreme scenarios to understand its limitations and robustness.
- Documentation Review: Reviewing the model documentation, including the Hierarchical Summary, to ensure completeness, clarity, and alignment with regulatory requirements.
- Ongoing Monitoring: Establishing processes to continuously monitor the model's performance and trigger revalidation when necessary.

The findings and recommendations from the validation process are documented in the sections that follow.

5.2. Backtesting
The backtesting of the risk calculation model involved the following steps:

1. Obtaining historical risk factor data for a representative sample of trades and portfolios covered by the model.
2. Recalculating the risk scores for the historical data using the `RiskCalculator` class and comparing the results to the actual observed outcomes.
3. Analyzing the accuracy, stability, and consistency of the model's risk predictions over time.

The backtesting results showed that the model's risk calculations were generally accurate, with a low rate of false positives and negatives. The model demonstrated stable performance across different market conditions and was able to capture the relative risk levels of the tested portfolios. However, the backtesting also identified some instances where the model's risk assessments deviated from the observed outcomes, particularly for certain risk factor combinations or extreme market events.

5.3. Benchmarking
The risk calculation model was benchmarked against two alternative models used within the bank for similar risk assessment purposes. The key findings from the benchmarking exercise are as follows:

- The model's overall risk scores and category-level breakdowns were generally aligned with the results of the alternative models, indicating consistency in the risk assessment approach.
- However, the model demonstrated more granular and nuanced risk factor analysis compared to the alternative models, providing a more detailed and transparent view of the underlying risk drivers.
- In certain market conditions or for specific trade types, the model's risk assessments diverged from the alternative models, suggesting potential differences in the underlying assumptions or methodologies.

The benchmarking results suggest that the model is a viable and competitive option for risk calculation, with some unique strengths in its risk factor analysis capabilities. Further investigation may be warranted to understand the drivers of the observed differences between the models.

5.4. Sensitivity and Stress Testing
The sensitivity and stress testing of the risk calculation model involved the following activities:

1. Systematically varying the input risk factor values and weights to assess the model's responsiveness and stability.
2. Applying extreme market scenarios, such as historical crisis events or hypothetical stress conditions, to evaluate the model's behavior under severe conditions.
3. Analyzing the impact of parameter changes, such as the risk threshold, on the model's risk categorization and reporting.

The sensitivity analysis showed that the model's risk scores were generally responsive to changes in risk factor values and weights, with the magnitude of the impact aligning with the relative importance of each factor. However, the model demonstrated some resilience to minor fluctuations, indicating a degree of stability and robustness.

The stress testing results revealed that the model was able to capture the increased risk levels under extreme market conditions, with the risk scores and category breakdowns reflecting the heightened volatility and potential losses. However, the model also exhibited some limitations in its ability to fully capture the tail risks and non-linear relationships that may arise during such events.

Overall, the sensitivity and stress testing provided valuable insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses, informing potential areas for enhancement or additional monitoring.
