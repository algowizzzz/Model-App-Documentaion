SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file, `pfe_calculation/pfe_computer.py`, is to provide a class `PFEQuantileCalculator` that calculates the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profile at a given quantile based on a set of exposure paths.
   - This file is a key component within the broader model or system, as it encapsulates the core logic for computing the PFE, which is a crucial risk metric used in various financial applications.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - `PFEQuantileCalculator` class:
     - **Purpose:** Calculates the PFE profile at a specified quantile from a set of exposure paths.
     - **Key Operations:** Computes the quantile of positive exposures across paths for each time step, resulting in the PFE profile.
     - **Inputs:** An array of exposure values, where each row represents the exposures at a specific time step and each column represents a path.
     - **Outputs:** A numpy array representing the PFE profile, where each element corresponds to the PFE value at a specific time step.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The core logic implemented in this file is the `calculate_pfe_profile` method of the `PFEQuantileCalculator` class. This method uses the `np.percentile` function to compute the specified quantile of positive exposures across paths for each time step, resulting in the PFE profile.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure used in this file is a 2D numpy array `exposure_paths`, which represents the exposure values over time and across multiple paths.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This file does not have any direct internal dependencies within the codebase.
   - **External:** This file depends on the `numpy` library for numerical operations and data manipulation.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The file includes explicit error handling by raising a `ValueError` if the provided quantile is not between 0 and 1 (exclusive).
   - The file also includes logging functionality, where it prints messages to indicate the initialization of the `PFEQuantileCalculator` and the successful calculation of the PFE profile.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - Assumptions:
     - The input `exposure_paths` array is a 2D numpy array with the expected shape of `(num_time_steps + 1, num_paths)`, where the first row represents the exposures at time t=0 (usually 0).
     - The input quantile value is between 0 and 1 (exclusive).
   - Limitations:
     - This file does not handle any system-wide assumptions or limitations, as it is focused on the specific task of calculating the PFE profile based on the provided exposure paths.
