1.3. Intended Users

The primary intended users of this model and its outputs are the risk management and regulatory reporting teams within BMO. Specifically, this model is designed to serve the following key user groups:

1. **Risk Managers**: The risk calculation and reporting functionality provided by this model is a critical input for the bank's overall risk management processes. Risk managers will utilize the model's outputs, such as the total risk score, risk breakdown by category, and risk status (high-risk or low-risk), to assess the risk profile of the bank's trading portfolios and make informed decisions about risk mitigation strategies.

2. **Regulatory Reporting Teams**: The comprehensive risk reports generated by this model are essential for fulfilling the bank's regulatory reporting obligations. Regulatory bodies, such as the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) in Canada, require financial institutions to provide detailed risk assessments and calculations as part of their capital adequacy and risk management frameworks. The risk reports produced by this model will be a key component of BMO's regulatory submissions.

3. **Senior Management and Executives**: While not the primary day-to-day users, the model's outputs may also be reviewed by senior management and executive-level stakeholders. These high-level users will rely on the model's risk assessments and reporting to gain a holistic understanding of the bank's risk profile, inform strategic decision-making, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

It is important to note that the model's scope and applicability are limited to the specific products, portfolios, and processes outlined in Section 1.2 of this documentation. The model is not designed for use by individual traders, clients, or other external parties. The intended users are internal BMO teams responsible for enterprise-wide risk management and regulatory reporting.
