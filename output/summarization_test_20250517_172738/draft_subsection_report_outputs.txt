6.1. Description of Output Files/Reports

This section provides a detailed overview of the key output files and reports generated by the risk calculation model implemented in the `complex_module.py` file.

The primary output of the model is a comprehensive risk report, which is generated by the `create_risk_report` function. This function takes an instance of the `RiskCalculator` class as input and produces a detailed report containing the following information:

- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the risk report was generated.
- **Total Risk Score**: The overall risk score calculated by the `RiskCalculator` class, which represents the aggregated impact of all the risk factors.
- **Risk Breakdown by Category**: A breakdown of the risk scores for each category of risk factors, providing visibility into the relative contribution of different risk types.
- **Risk Status**: A classification of the overall risk level as either "High Risk" or "Low Risk", based on a predefined risk threshold.

The risk report is returned as a dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    "timestamp": datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "total_risk": total_risk_score,
    "risk_breakdown": risk_breakdown,
    "risk_status": "High Risk" if total_risk_score >= risk_threshold else "Low Risk"
}
```

The `risk_breakdown` field in the report is a dictionary that maps each risk factor category to its corresponding risk score. For example:

```python
{
    "market_risk": 0.45,
    "credit_risk": 0.25,
    "operational_risk": 0.15,
    "liquidity_risk": 0.10
}
```

The risk report can be used by various stakeholders, such as risk managers, compliance teams, and senior executives, to understand the overall risk profile of the model's underlying portfolio or exposures. The report provides a concise and actionable summary of the key risk metrics, enabling informed decision-making and risk mitigation strategies.

It is important to note that the output files and reports generated by this model are intended for internal use and may be subject to confidentiality and regulatory requirements. Access to these outputs should be restricted and controlled accordingly.
