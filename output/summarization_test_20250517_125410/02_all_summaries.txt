================================================================================File: README.md

The provided file is a README.md that describes a Python project for calculating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) for a portfolio of Equity Total Return Swaps (TRS) using Monte Carlo simulation. The main purpose of the project is to estimate the potential future credit exposure arising from these derivative trades by simulating the underlying equity prices and valuing the trades across multiple scenarios.

The project is structured into several modules:

1. `data_management/`: Handles loading and managing input data such as trade details, market data, and simulation parameters from JSON files.
2. `financial_instruments/`: Defines and values financial instruments like Equity TRS.
3. `simulation_engine/`: Implements the Monte Carlo simulation and the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model for simulating underlying equity price paths.
4. `pfe_calculation/`: Calculates exposures and aggregates PFE profiles for individual trades and the portfolio.
5. `reporting/`: Writes the output PFE results to files.

The main workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Load input data from JSON files.
2. Simulate multiple price paths for each underlying asset using the GBM model.
3. Value the Equity TRS trades for each simulated price path and time step.
4. Calculate exposures as the positive mark-to-market values for each trade and path.
5. Compute the PFE profile for each trade by taking a percentile of the exposures across all paths.
6. Optionally, aggregate the PFE profiles across all trades.
7. Write the individual and aggregated PFE profiles to output files.

The project utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation technique and the Geometric Brownian Motion model, which is a widely used stochastic process for modeling asset prices in finance. The PFE calculation involves computing exposures, taking percentiles, and potentially aggregating across trades, which are common approaches in counterparty credit risk management.

File: main_pfe_runner.py

The `main_pfe_runner.py` file serves as the main entry point and orchestrator for a Monte Carlo simulation-based Potential Future Exposure (PFE) calculation process. Its primary purpose is to coordinate the various components involved in simulating asset price paths, valuing financial instruments, calculating exposure profiles, and aggregating PFE results across multiple trades.

The key components are:

1. `PFECalculationOrchestrator` class: This class orchestrates the entire PFE calculation workflow. It initializes and manages the dependencies, processes individual trades, and writes the final results.

2. `process_single_trade` method: This method handles the PFE calculation for a single trade. It simulates asset price paths, values the financial instrument (EquityTRS), calculates exposure paths, and computes the PFE profile for the trade.

3. `run_full_pfe_calculation` method: This method runs the PFE calculation for all trades, aggregates the individual PFE profiles, and writes the results to an output directory.

The file relies on several external components, such as `ConfigManager` for loading configuration and market data, `MonteCarloEngine` for asset price simulation, `EquityTRS` for valuing equity total return swaps, `PFEQuantileCalculator` for calculating PFE profiles, `TradeAggregator` for aggregating individual PFE profiles, and `ResultsWriter` for writing the results to files.

The main algorithm used is the Monte Carlo simulation method for generating asset price paths, which are then used to value the financial instruments and calculate exposure profiles. The PFE profiles are computed by applying a quantile calculation (e.g., 95th percentile) on the exposure paths. The individual PFE profiles are aggregated using a simple sum approach, although more sophisticated aggregation methods could be implemented.

File: reporting/output_writer.py

The main purpose of this file is to provide a class `ResultsWriter` that handles writing Potential Future Exposure (PFE) results to JSON files. The key components are:

1. `ResultsWriter` class:
   - Initializes with an output directory and a simulation ID.
   - Creates the output directory if it doesn't exist.
   - Provides a method `write_pfe_results` to write aggregated and individual PFE profiles to a JSON file.

2. `_prepare_data_for_json` method:
   - Converts NumPy arrays and nested data structures to Python lists for JSON serialization.
   - Recursively handles nested dictionaries and lists.

The `write_pfe_results` method is the main entry point for writing PFE results. It takes two arguments:

- `aggregated_pfe_profile`: A NumPy array representing the aggregated PFE profile.
- `individual_pfe_profiles`: A dictionary where keys are trade IDs, and values are NumPy arrays representing individual PFE profiles.

The method constructs a dictionary with the simulation ID, aggregated PFE profile, and individual trade PFE profiles. It then writes this data to a JSON file in the specified output directory.

The file also includes a `main` function for testing purposes, which creates a `ResultsWriter` instance, generates sample PFE data, and calls the `write_pfe_results` method.

The file has dependencies on the `json`, `os`, and `numpy` modules. It uses NumPy arrays to represent PFE profiles and handles the conversion of these arrays to JSON-serializable data structures using the `_prepare_data_for_json` method.

Overall, the file follows a straightforward object-oriented design pattern, with the `ResultsWriter` class encapsulating the functionality for writing PFE results to files. The code is well-documented and includes error handling for common exceptions that may occur during file operations and data serialization.

File: data_management/loader.py

The `data_management/loader.py` file is responsible for loading various types of data from JSON files, primarily for use in a trading or financial simulation application. The main purpose of this file is to provide a centralized and consistent way to load and manage configuration data required for the application.

Key Components:

1. `load_json_data(file_path: str)`: A utility function that loads data from a specified JSON file. It handles file not found and JSON decoding errors, and returns the loaded data as a Python object.

2. `get_trades(config_dir: str)`, `get_market_data(config_dir: str)`, and `get_simulation_params(config_dir: str)`: These functions use `load_json_data` to load specific types of data (trades, market data, and simulation parameters, respectively) from JSON files located in the specified configuration directory.

3. `ConfigManager` class: This class provides a convenient way to manage the loading of all required configuration data. It has an `__init__` method to set the configuration directory and initialize data attributes, and a `load_all` method that calls the respective `get_*` functions to load all configuration data.

Important Relationships and Dependencies:

- The file uses the built-in `json` and `os` modules for JSON handling and file path operations, respectively.

Notable Algorithms or Patterns:

- The `load_json_data` function follows a try-except pattern to handle different types of exceptions that may occur during file loading and JSON decoding.
- The `ConfigManager` class follows the Singleton pattern, as it is designed to have a single instance managing the configuration data for the entire application.

Overall, this file provides a modular and extensible approach to loading and managing configuration data from JSON files, which can be easily integrated into a larger application or system.

File: simulation_engine/monte_carlo_simulator.py

The `monte_carlo_simulator.py` file contains a class `MonteCarloEngine` that orchestrates Monte Carlo simulations for various assets. The main purpose of this file is to provide a modular and extensible framework for running Monte Carlo simulations, particularly for financial applications such as option pricing.

The key components of this file are:

1. `MonteCarloEngine` class: This class serves as the entry point for running Monte Carlo simulations. It initializes with the number of paths to simulate and provides a `run_asset_simulation` method to simulate price paths for a given asset.

2. `run_asset_simulation` method: This method takes asset market data (current price, risk-free rate, dividend yield, and volatility), the total number of time steps, and the time delta (time increment per step). It utilizes the `GBMProcess` class (imported from `gbm_model`) to generate price paths based on the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model.

The `MonteCarloEngine` class has a dependency on the `GBMProcess` class from the `gbm_model` module. This dependency is used to generate price paths based on the GBM model, which is a widely used stochastic process for modeling asset prices in finance.

The file also includes a test section (`if __name__ == '__main__'`) that demonstrates how to instantiate the `MonteCarloEngine` class and run a simulation for a specific asset with provided market data.

Overall, this file provides a modular and extensible framework for running Monte Carlo simulations, particularly for financial applications involving asset pricing and option valuation. It leverages the GBM model as the underlying stochastic process for generating asset price paths.

File: simulation_engine/__init__.py

SUMMARY:

1. The main purpose of this file is to serve as the entry point for the `simulation_engine` package. It is a Python package initializer file (`__init__.py`), which allows the package to be treated as a module and its contents to be imported into other parts of the application.

2. Key components:
   - There are no functions, classes, or methods defined in this file.

3. Important relationships or dependencies:
   - This file does not import or depend on any other modules or packages.

4. Notable algorithms or patterns:
   - There are no notable algorithms or patterns used in this file.

This file is an empty Python script, which is a common practice for package initialization files. Its primary role is to mark the directory as a Python package, allowing other modules within the package to be imported and used throughout the application. While this file does not contain any code, it is an essential component of the package structure and enables the proper organization and importation of the `simulation_engine` package's modules.

File: simulation_engine/gbm_model.py

The `simulation_engine/gbm_model.py` file provides an implementation of the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices over time. The main purpose of this file is to generate multiple paths of asset prices based on the GBM model, which is widely used in finance for modeling stock prices and other financial instruments.

The key component of this file is the `GBMProcess` class, which encapsulates the GBM model and provides methods for generating asset price paths. The class has the following methods:

1. `__init__` (constructor): Initializes the GBM process with the initial asset price, drift rate (expected rate of return), volatility, and time delta (time increment for each step).
2. `generate_paths`: Generates multiple asset price paths based on the GBM model. It takes the number of time steps and the number of paths as input and returns a NumPy array containing the simulated asset prices for each path.

The `generate_paths` method implements the GBM model using the following equation:

```
S(t+dt) = S(t) * exp((mu - 0.5 * sigma^2) * dt + sigma * sqrt(dt) * Z)
```

where `S(t)` is the asset price at time `t`, `mu` is the drift rate, `sigma` is the volatility, `dt` is the time delta, and `Z` is a standard normal random variable.

The file also includes a simple test case in the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block, which creates a `GBMProcess` instance and generates a set of asset price paths for a one-year period with monthly time steps.

The implementation relies on the NumPy library for efficient numerical computations and random number generation. The code follows a straightforward object-oriented design pattern, encapsulating the GBM model and its parameters within the `GBMProcess` class.

Overall, this file provides a concise and reusable implementation of the Geometric Brownian Motion process for simulating asset prices, which can be useful in various financial modeling and risk management applications.

File: financial_instruments/equity_trs.py

The `financial_instruments/equity_trs.py` file defines a class `EquityTRS` to represent and value an Equity Total Return Swap (TRS) contract. The main purpose of this file is to provide a way to calculate the mark-to-market (MtM) value and exposure of an Equity TRS based on the underlying equity price paths.

The key components are:

1. `EquityTRS` class:
   - Initializes the TRS contract with trade details such as notional, initial price, and trade type (receive or pay equity return).
   - `calculate_mtm` method: Calculates the MtM value of the TRS for a given set of underlying equity price paths.
   - `calculate_exposure` method: Calculates the exposure (max(0, MtM)) from the MtM values, assuming positive MtM means the counterparty owes us.

The `EquityTRS` class assumes that the funding leg (fixed or floating rate payments) is netted against the equity leg at each valuation date, and the focus is on the change in equity value. The MtM calculation is based on the ratio change of the underlying equity price compared to the initial price at inception, multiplied by the notional amount. The trade type (receive or pay equity return) determines the sign of the MtM value.

The file uses NumPy for array operations and assumes that the underlying equity price paths are provided as a NumPy array with shape `(num_time_steps + 1, num_paths)`.

The main algorithm used is the calculation of the MtM value based on the ratio change of the underlying equity price compared to the initial price at inception, multiplied by the notional amount. The exposure calculation follows a simple pattern of taking the maximum of 0 and the MtM value for each path and time step.

Overall, this file provides a straightforward implementation for valuing and calculating the exposure of an Equity TRS contract, which can be useful in financial risk management and pricing applications.

File: financial_instruments/__init__.py

SUMMARY:

1. The main purpose of this file:
The `__init__.py` file in the `financial_instruments` package serves as the entry point for the package. It is responsible for initializing the package and defining what components are available for import from the package.

2. Key components (functions, classes, methods) and their purposes:
This file does not contain any functions, classes, or methods. It is an empty file, which is a common practice in Python packages.

3. Important relationships or dependencies:
Since the file is empty, there are no explicit relationships or dependencies defined within this file. However, the presence of this file indicates that the `financial_instruments` directory is treated as a Python package, allowing other modules within the package to be imported and used together.

4. Notable algorithms or patterns used:
There are no algorithms or specific patterns implemented in this file. It is a standard Python package initialization file.

In summary, the `financial_instruments/__init__.py` file is an empty file that serves as a marker for Python to recognize the `financial_instruments` directory as a package. It does not contain any code or functionality itself, but its presence allows other modules within the package to be imported and used together. This file is a common convention in Python package structure and does not require any additional code or implementation.

File: pfe_calculation/pfe_computer.py

The main purpose of this file is to provide a class `PFEQuantileCalculator` that calculates the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profile at a given quantile from a set of exposure paths. The PFE profile represents the quantile of positive exposures across all paths at each time step.

The key components are:

1. `PFEQuantileCalculator` class:
   - Initializes with a quantile value between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.95 for 95th percentile).
   - `calculate_pfe_profile` method: Calculates the PFE profile from exposure paths. It takes a 2D numpy array of exposure values (time steps x paths) and returns a 1D array of PFE values over time.

The `calculate_pfe_profile` method uses the `numpy.percentile` function to calculate the specified quantile of positive exposures across paths for each time step. It ensures that the resulting PFE values are non-negative.

The file has no external dependencies other than the NumPy library for array operations.

The main algorithm used is the calculation of quantiles across exposure paths for each time step. This is achieved by leveraging NumPy's `percentile` function, which efficiently computes quantiles along a specified axis of a multi-dimensional array.

The file also includes a `main` section that demonstrates the usage of the `PFEQuantileCalculator` class with example exposure paths and different quantile values (95th and 50th percentiles).

Overall, this file provides a concise and efficient implementation for calculating the PFE profile, which is a common risk metric in financial risk management.

File: pfe_calculation/exposure_aggregator.py

The `exposure_aggregator.py` file contains a class `TradeAggregator` that is designed to aggregate Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades. The main purpose of this file is to provide a simple implementation for combining PFE profiles, which is a crucial step in calculating portfolio-level risk measures.

The key components of this file are:

1. `TradeAggregator` class:
   - `__init__()`: Initializes the class and creates a dictionary to store individual trade PFE profiles.
   - `add_trade_pfe_profile(trade_id, pfe_profile)`: Stores the PFE profile for a single trade, identified by a `trade_id`.
   - `get_all_individual_pfe_profiles()`: Returns a dictionary containing all stored individual trade PFE profiles.
   - `calculate_simple_sum_pfe()`: Implements a basic aggregation method by summing the PFE profiles of all trades. This method serves as a simple example and is not representative of how portfolio PFE is typically calculated due to netting effects.

The `TradeAggregator` class does not have any external dependencies, except for the `numpy` library, which is used for array operations.

The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe()` method demonstrates a simple algorithm for aggregating PFE profiles by summing the individual trade profiles. However, the code acknowledges that this approach is generally not used in practice due to the need to account for netting effects when calculating portfolio-level PFE.

The file also includes a `main` section that serves as a basic test case for the `TradeAggregator` class, demonstrating how to create an instance, add individual trade PFE profiles, retrieve them, and perform the simple summation aggregation.

Overall, this file provides a basic framework for aggregating PFE profiles across trades, with the potential for future extensions to incorporate more sophisticated aggregation methods that account for netting effects and other portfolio-level considerations.
