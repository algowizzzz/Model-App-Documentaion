1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file (`README.md`) is to provide an overview and documentation for the Monte Carlo PFE Calculator for Equity TRS project.
   - This file serves as the entry point and guide for understanding the project's structure, workflow, and components. It does not contain any executable code but rather acts as a reference document.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - This file does not contain any classes, functions, or methods. It is a Markdown file that provides a high-level description of the project's components and their roles.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The file outlines the core workflow and algorithms used in the project, which include:
     - Simulating equity price paths using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model.
     - Valuing Equity Total Return Swaps (TRS) for each simulated price path.
     - Calculating exposures at each time step based on the mark-to-market (MtM) values.
     - Computing Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles for individual trades by taking a percentile of positive exposures across simulated paths.
     - Optionally aggregating PFE profiles across trades (e.g., summing individual PFE profiles).

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file does not explicitly define any data structures. However, it mentions that the project likely utilizes data structures to represent trade details, market parameters, simulation settings, and PFE results.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** The file mentions several directories and modules within the project, suggesting internal dependencies:
     - `config/`: For loading trade data, market data, and simulation parameters.
     - `data_management/`: For managing input data.
     - `financial_instruments/`: For defining and valuing financial instruments like Equity TRS.
     - `pfe_calculation/`: For calculating exposures and aggregating PFE.
     - `reporting/`: For writing output results.
     - `simulation_engine/`: For the Monte Carlo simulation and stochastic processes like GBM.
   - **External:** The file does not explicitly mention any external libraries or packages.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The file does not provide any information about error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities implemented in the project.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - As a README file, it does not contain any executable code or logic. Therefore, there are no specific assumptions or limitations related to this file itself.
   - However, the file mentions some assumptions and limitations inherent to the project's approach, such as:
     - Modeling equity prices using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, which may not accurately capture all market dynamics.
     - Calculating PFE based on a specific percentile of positive exposures, which may not fully represent tail risk.
     - Optionally aggregating PFE profiles by summing individual profiles, which may not accurately capture portfolio effects.
