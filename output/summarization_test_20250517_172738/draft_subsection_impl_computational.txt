4.5. Computational Aspects

This section outlines the key computational aspects and technical dependencies of the model implementation.

Programming Languages and Libraries
The model is primarily implemented in Python, utilizing the following key libraries and packages:

- `typing`: For type annotations and improved code readability.
- `dataclasses`: Used to create the `RiskFactor` data class, which represents a single risk factor with its name, weight, value, and category.
- `datetime`: Utilized to generate the timestamp for the risk report.

The codebase also includes a test JavaScript file, `app.js`, which is used for verifying the handling of non-Python files within the broader system. However, this JavaScript file does not have a direct relationship with the core risk calculation and reporting functionality implemented in the Python module.

Computational Resources and Dependencies
The model does not appear to have any significant computational resource requirements or external dependencies beyond the Python libraries mentioned above. The risk calculation and reporting functionality is self-contained within the `complex_module.py` file and does not rely on any external data sources or services.

The `config.json` file specifies a few configuration settings, such as the maximum number of retries and timeout values, which may impact the computational aspects of the model's execution. However, these settings are specific to the test project and do not directly reflect the computational requirements of the core risk calculation logic.

Overall, the model's computational aspects are relatively straightforward, with the primary focus being on the implementation of the risk calculation and reporting functionality within the Python module. The model does not seem to have any unusual or specialized computational requirements beyond standard Python development.
