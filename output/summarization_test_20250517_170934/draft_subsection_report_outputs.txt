6.1. Description of Output Files/Reports

This section provides a detailed overview of the key output files and reports generated by the model.

The model's primary output is a comprehensive risk report, which is generated by the `create_risk_report` function in the `complex_module.py` file. This function takes a `RiskCalculator` instance as input and produces a detailed report containing the following information:

- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the risk report was generated.
- **Total Risk Score**: The overall risk score calculated by the `RiskCalculator` class, normalized to a scale of 0 to 1.
- **Risk Breakdown by Category**: A breakdown of the risk scores for each category, calculated by the `get_risk_breakdown` method in the `RiskCalculator` class.
- **Risk Status**: A classification of the overall risk as either "High Risk" or "Low Risk", based on a predefined risk threshold.

The risk report is returned as a dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "total_risk": total_risk_score,
    "risk_breakdown": risk_breakdown,
    "status": "High Risk" if total_risk_score >= risk_threshold else "Low Risk"
}
```

This risk report can be used for various purposes, such as risk management, regulatory reporting, and business decision-making. The intended users of this report are likely risk managers, compliance officers, and senior stakeholders.

In addition to the risk report, the model may generate other output files or reports, such as:

- **Risk Factor Data**: The `RiskFactor` class in `complex_module.py` represents a single risk factor, including its name, weight, value, and category. This data could be exported or reported separately to provide detailed information about the individual risk factors.
- **Model Validation and Testing Results**: The `test_sample.py` file contains sample Python structures and functions that could be used for testing and validation purposes. Any reports or logs generated from these tests may be considered additional model outputs.
- **Configuration and Metadata**: The `config.json` file stores project-level configuration settings and dependencies, which could be included in model documentation or reporting.

However, the provided codebase summaries do not indicate the existence of any other output files or reports beyond the risk report generated by the `create_risk_report` function. If additional output files or reports are required, further investigation or clarification may be needed.
