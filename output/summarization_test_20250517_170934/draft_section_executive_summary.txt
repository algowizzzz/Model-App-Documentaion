Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of a complex model implementation within the BMO codebase. The model is designed to calculate and assess various risk factors, with the primary purpose of generating detailed risk reports for senior stakeholders and regulatory authorities.

The model consists of several key components:

1. **RiskFactor Class**: Represents an individual risk factor, including its name, weight, value, and category. This class is responsible for calculating the weighted impact of each risk factor.

2. **RiskCalculator Class**: Handles the aggregation and analysis of multiple risk factors. It calculates the total risk score, provides a breakdown of risk scores by category, and validates the input risk factors.

3. **create_risk_report Function**: Generates a comprehensive risk report based on the output of the RiskCalculator, including the total risk score, risk breakdown, and an overall status (high-risk or low-risk) based on a defined risk threshold.

The model's key methodologies include:

- Weighted sum of risk factors to calculate the total risk score
- Normalization of risk scores to a 0-1 scale
- Categorization of risk factors and calculation of risk breakdown by category
- Validation of risk factor inputs to ensure they meet defined criteria

The primary results of this model are the detailed risk reports, which provide senior stakeholders and regulators with a comprehensive understanding of the organization's risk profile. These reports include the total risk score, the breakdown of risk by category, and an assessment of the overall risk status.

Overall, the model appears to be sound and fit for its intended purpose of risk assessment and reporting. However, there are a few notable limitations:

1. The model does not currently support loading risk factor data from external sources, such as a database or API. The risk factors are hardcoded in the example usage.
2. The `create_risk_report` function does not offer customization options for the report format or content beyond the predefined structure.

To enhance the model's capabilities and address these limitations, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. Implement a mechanism to load risk factor data from external sources, such as a database or API, to improve the model's flexibility and maintainability.
2. Expand the `create_risk_report` function to allow for greater customization of the report format and content, enabling users to tailor the output to their specific needs.

With these enhancements, the model would be better equipped to serve the organization's risk management and regulatory reporting requirements.
