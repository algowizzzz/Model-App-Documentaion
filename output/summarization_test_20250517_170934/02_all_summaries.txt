File: config.json

SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this `config.json` file is to store configuration settings and metadata for a test project.
   - This file serves as a centralized location to define various parameters and dependencies that are likely used across multiple components or modules within the broader system or application.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - The file contains the following key components:
     - `name`: Specifies the name of the test project.
     - `version`: Indicates the version of the test project.
     - `description`: Provides a brief description of the test project.
     - `settings`: Contains a set of configuration settings, including:

     - `dependencies`: A list of external modules or packages required by the test project.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - This `config.json` file does not contain any core algorithms or significant business logic. It is primarily a configuration file that stores project-level settings and dependencies.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file uses a standard JSON data structure, which is a hierarchical key-value store. The top-level keys represent the different configuration parameters, and their corresponding values can be of various data types (string, boolean, integer).

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This `config.json` file does not have any direct internal dependencies within the codebase. It is a standalone configuration file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - The `config.json` file assumes that the configuration parameters it defines are valid and appropriate for the test project. It does not perform any validation or sanity checks on the input values.
   - The file has no inherent limitations, as it is a simple configuration file. Its limitations would depend on how the consuming code utilizes and interprets the configuration settings.

File: query.sql

SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to define a SQL query that retrieves user data from a database table.
   - This query serves as a component within a broader system or application, likely responsible for fetching and processing user information.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - The file contains a single SQL query with the following components:
     - **CREATE TABLE users**: This statement defines a database table named "users" with the following columns:
       - `id`: An integer primary key column.
       - `name`: A VARCHAR(100) column to store the user's name.
       - `email`: A VARCHAR(255) column to store the user's email address, with a unique constraint.
       - `created_at`: A TIMESTAMP column to store the user's account creation date, with a default value of the current timestamp.
     - **SELECT u.name, u.email**: This part of the query selects the `name` and `email` columns from the `users` table.
     - **FROM users u**: This specifies that the data should be retrieved from the `users` table, with the table alias `u`.
     - **WHERE u.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 7 DAY)**: This filter ensures that only users created within the last 7 days are included in the results.
     - **ORDER BY u.created_at DESC**: This sorts the results in descending order by the `created_at` column, so the most recently created users are listed first.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The file does not contain any complex algorithms or unique business logic. It simply defines a SQL query to retrieve a subset of user data based on the creation date.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file does not define any internal data structures. It operates directly on the `users` database table.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** The file does not have any internal dependencies, as it contains a standalone SQL query.
   - **External:** The file relies on the underlying database management system (DBMS) to execute the SQL query and retrieve the requested data.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The file does not contain any explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities. Error handling and logging would likely be handled at a higher level, outside of this specific SQL query.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that the `users` table exists in the database and has the specified schema (with the `id`, `name`, `email`, and `created_at` columns).
   - The file assumes that the `DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 7 DAY)` function is supported by the underlying DBMS and correctly calculates the date 7 days prior to the current date.
   - The file does not have any other specific assumptions or limitations beyond those inherent to the SQL query itself.

     - Inputs: RiskCalculator instance.
     - Outputs: Dictionary containing the risk report (timestamp, total risk, breakdown, and status).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The `RiskCalculator` class implements the core logic for calculating and aggregating risk scores. It performs a weighted sum of all risk factors, normalizing the total impact to a 0-1 scale.
   - The `get_risk_breakdown` method in the `RiskCalculator` class calculates the risk scores for each category by summing the weighted impacts of the risk factors within each category.
   - The `_validate_factors` method in the `RiskCalculator` class checks for invalid weights and values in the risk factors.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The `RiskFactor` class is a custom data structure that represents a single risk factor with its name, weight, value, and category.
   - The `RiskCalculator` class maintains a dictionary `_cache` to store intermediate results.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This file does not have any direct dependencies on other modules within the codebase.
   - **External:** This file utilizes the following external libraries:
     - `typing`: For type annotations.
     - `dataclasses`: For creating the `RiskFactor` data class.
     - `datetime`: For generating the timestamp in the risk report.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `_validate_factors` method in the `RiskCalculator` class checks for invalid weights and values in the risk factors and returns a list of validation error messages.
   - There is no explicit logging functionality implemented in this file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - Assumptions:
     - The `RiskFactor` class assumes that the weight and value of a risk factor are within valid ranges (weight between 0 and 1, value greater than or equal to 0).
     - The `RiskCalculator` class assumes that the list of risk factors provided during initialization is non-empty.
   - Limitations:
     - This file does not handle any external data sources or dependencies, such as loading risk factor data from a database or external API. The risk factors are hardcoded in the example usage at the end of the file.
     - The `create_risk_report` function does not provide any options for customizing the report format or content beyond the predefined structure.
