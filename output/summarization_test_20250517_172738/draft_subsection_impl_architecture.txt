4.1. System Architecture

This section provides a high-level overview of the system components, modules, and their interactions that comprise the risk calculation and reporting functionality implemented in the codebase.

The codebase consists of three key files: `config.json`, `complex_module.py`, and `app.js`. While `app.js` serves as a test file for handling non-Python components, the other two files play crucial roles in the system's architecture.

The `config.json` file is responsible for defining the configuration settings for the test project. It contains metadata about the project, such as the name, version, and description, as well as various settings that control the project's behavior, including debug mode, maximum retries, and timeout values. This configuration file is likely used by other components or modules within the broader system to control the execution and parameters of the risk calculation and reporting functionality.

The core of the system's architecture is implemented in the `complex_module.py` file. This module contains the following key components:

1. **RiskFactor Class**:
   - Purpose: Represents a single risk factor with its name, weight, value, and category.
   - Functionality: Calculates the weighted impact of the risk factor.

2. **RiskCalculator Class**:
   - Purpose: Handles the calculation and aggregation of risk scores based on a list of risk factors.
   - Key Functionality:
     - Calculates the total risk score across all factors.
     - Provides a breakdown of risk scores by category.
     - Validates the risk factors.

3. **create_risk_report Function**:
   - Purpose: Generates a comprehensive risk report based on a RiskCalculator instance.
   - Functionality: Calculates the total risk, risk breakdown, and status (high-risk or low-risk) based on the risk threshold.

The `RiskCalculator` class is the central component responsible for the core risk calculation and aggregation logic. It performs a weighted sum of all risk factors, normalizing the total impact to a 0-1 scale. The `get_risk_breakdown` method in this class calculates the risk scores for each category by summing the weighted impacts of the risk factors within each category. The `_validate_factors` method checks for invalid weights and values in the risk factors.

The `create_risk_report` function generates a comprehensive risk report, including the timestamp, total risk, breakdown by category, and the overall risk status (high-risk or low-risk) based on the risk threshold.

The overall system architecture can be summarized as follows:

1. The `config.json` file provides the configuration settings for the test project, which may be used by other components or modules within the broader system.
2. The `complex_module.py` file contains the core risk calculation and reporting functionality, including the `RiskFactor`, `RiskCalculator`, and `create_risk_report` components.
3. The `app.js` file serves as a test file for handling non-Python components and does not have a direct relationship with the other files in the codebase.

This modular design allows for better maintainability, testability, and potential reuse of the individual components within the broader system. However, the codebase summaries provided do not indicate how these components are integrated or used within the larger system context.

[Information regarding the integration of these components with other parts of the broader system or model needs to be sourced/further investigated as it is not fully available in the provided codebase summaries.]
