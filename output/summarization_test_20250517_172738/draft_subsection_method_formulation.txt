2.2. Mathematical Formulation

This section presents the key mathematical formulations, algorithms, and logical steps involved in the model's risk calculation and reporting functionality, as implemented in the `complex_module.py` file.

The model's core components are the `RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator` classes, which work together to represent individual risk factors and calculate the overall risk score, respectively.

**RiskFactor Class**
The `RiskFactor` class represents a single risk factor, with the following attributes:
- `name`: The name of the risk factor.
- `weight`: The weight or importance of the risk factor, a value between 0 and 1.
- `value`: The current value or magnitude of the risk factor, a non-negative number.
- `category`: The category or type of the risk factor.

The key operation of the `RiskFactor` class is the calculation of the weighted impact of the risk factor, which is computed as:
```
weighted_impact = weight * value
```

**RiskCalculator Class**
The `RiskCalculator` class is responsible for the overall risk calculation and aggregation. It takes a list of `RiskFactor` instances and a risk threshold as input, and provides the following key functionality:

1. **Total Risk Score Calculation**:
   - The total risk score is calculated as the weighted sum of all risk factors' weighted impacts, normalized to the range [0, 1]:
     ```
     total_risk_score = sum(risk_factor.weighted_impact for risk_factor in risk_factors) / sum(risk_factor.weight for risk_factor in risk_factors)
     ```

2. **Risk Breakdown by Category**:
   - The `get_risk_breakdown` method calculates the risk score for each category by summing the weighted impacts of the risk factors within each category.
   - The breakdown is returned as a dictionary, with category names as keys and their corresponding risk scores as values.

3. **Risk Factor Validation**:
   - The `_validate_factors` method checks the list of risk factors for any invalid weights (outside the range [0, 1]) or values (negative). It returns a list of validation error messages, if any.

**Risk Report Generation**
The `create_risk_report` function takes a `RiskCalculator` instance as input and generates a comprehensive risk report. The report includes the following information:
- Timestamp of the report generation
- Total risk score
- Risk breakdown by category
- Risk status (high-risk or low-risk) based on the provided risk threshold

The report is returned as a dictionary with the following structure:
```
{
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "total_risk_score": total_risk_score,
    "risk_breakdown": risk_breakdown,
    "risk_status": "high-risk" if total_risk_score > risk_threshold else "low-risk"
}
```

In summary, the mathematical formulation and logical steps of the model's risk calculation and reporting functionality are centered around the `RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator` classes, which work together to represent individual risk factors, calculate the overall risk score, provide a breakdown by category, and generate a comprehensive risk report.
