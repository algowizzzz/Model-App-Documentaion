4.5. Computational Aspects

This section outlines the key computational aspects and technical dependencies of the model implementation.

The model codebase is primarily written in Python, with the core modeling and calculation logic implemented in the `complex_module.py` file. This module defines the `RiskFactor` class and the `RiskCalculator` class, which handle the calculation and aggregation of risk scores. The `create_risk_report` function in this module generates a comprehensive risk report based on the risk calculator.

In addition to the Python code, the codebase includes the following supporting components:

- **Presentation Layer**: The `styles.css` file defines the visual styles and layout for the web application's user interface.
- **Data and Configuration Management**: The `config.json` file stores project-level configuration settings and dependencies, while the `data.xml` file represents structured data related to persons.
- **Testing and Validation**: The `test_sample.py` file provides a set of Python structures and functions for testing and demonstration purposes, and the `invalid_syntax.py` file contains Python code with invalid syntax for error analysis.
- **Miscellaneous**: The `app.js` file is a test JavaScript file used to verify the handling of non-Python files, and the `query.sql` file defines a SQL query that retrieves user data from a database table.

The key computational dependencies and requirements for this model implementation are:

1. **Programming Languages**:
   - Primary language: Python
   - Secondary language: JavaScript (for the presentation layer)
   - SQL (for the database query)

2. **Key Libraries and Packages**:
   - Python:
     - `typing`: For type annotations
     - `dataclasses`: For creating the `RiskFactor` data class
     - `datetime`: For generating the timestamp in the risk report
   - JavaScript:
     - No external libraries or packages are used in the provided `app.js` file

3. **Computational Resources**:
   - The model implementation does not appear to have any significant computational resource requirements beyond a standard development environment. The risk calculation and reporting functionalities are relatively lightweight and do not seem to require specialized hardware or infrastructure.

4. **Other Dependencies**:
   - The model implementation relies on a database system to execute the SQL query defined in the `query.sql` file. The specific database management system (DBMS) is not specified, but the query should be compatible with standard SQL dialects.

Overall, the computational aspects of this model implementation are focused on Python-based modeling and calculation logic, with supporting components for data management, configuration, testing, and presentation. The codebase demonstrates a diverse set of technologies and file types, but the core computational requirements are relatively straightforward and do not appear to have any significant or specialized dependencies.
