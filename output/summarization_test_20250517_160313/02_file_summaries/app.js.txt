**SUMMARY:**

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - This file serves as a test or example JavaScript file to verify the handling of non-Python files within the broader system or codebase.
   - Its primary role is likely for testing, demonstration, or educational purposes rather than being a core component of a production model or system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **TestClass**
     - **Purpose:** A simple class for testing and demonstration purposes.
     - **Key Operations:** Initializes an instance with a value property and provides a `doubleValue` method to double a given number.
     - **Inputs:** The constructor takes a `value` parameter, and the `doubleValue` method takes a `number` parameter `x`.
     - **Outputs:** The `doubleValue` method returns the doubled value of the input `x`.
   - **testFunction**
     - **Purpose:** A simple function for testing and demonstration purposes.
     - **Key Operations:** Concatenates two input parameters into a string.
     - **Inputs:** The function takes two parameters: `param1` (required) and `param2` (optional, with a default value of "default").
     - **Outputs:** The function returns a string that combines the two input parameters separated by a hyphen.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - This file does not appear to implement any complex algorithms or significant business logic. It serves as a simple example or test case.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - No significant internal data structures are used or manipulated within this file.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** None.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - No explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities are implemented in this file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - **Assumptions:**
     - The `doubleValue` method assumes that the input `x` is a valid number.
     - The `testFunction` assumes that `param1` is provided and can be concatenated with `param2`.
   - **Limitations:**
     - This file does not have any significant limitations, as it is a simple test or example file.
