6. Reporting and Output

6.1. Description of Output Files/Reports

The model's primary outputs are a comprehensive risk report and a set of risk metrics. The risk report is generated by the `create_risk_report` function in the `complex_module.py` file. This function takes a `RiskCalculator` instance as input and produces a dictionary containing the following key information:

- Timestamp: The current date and time when the report was generated.
- Total Risk Score: The overall risk score calculated by the `RiskCalculator` class.
- Risk Breakdown: A breakdown of the risk scores by category, as calculated by the `get_risk_breakdown` method in the `RiskCalculator` class.
- Risk Status: A classification of the overall risk as either "High Risk" or "Low Risk" based on a predefined risk threshold.

The risk report provides a detailed summary of the model's risk assessment, including the aggregated risk score, the contribution of individual risk factors, and an overall risk status. This report is intended to be the primary output consumed by the model's intended users, such as risk managers and regulatory authorities.

In addition to the risk report, the model also generates a set of risk metrics that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems. These metrics include:

- Individual Risk Factor Scores: The weighted impact of each risk factor, as calculated by the `RiskFactor` class.
- Normalized Total Risk Score: The total risk score normalized to a 0-1 scale.
- Risk Breakdown by Category: The risk scores for each category, as calculated by the `get_risk_breakdown` method in the `RiskCalculator` class.

These risk metrics can be used for various purposes, such as monitoring risk trends, performing sensitivity analyses, or feeding into other risk management or reporting systems.

6.2. Interpretation of Results

The risk report and risk metrics generated by the model should be interpreted as follows:

Total Risk Score:
- The total risk score represents the overall risk exposure of the modeled portfolio or entity. A higher score indicates a higher level of risk.
- The total risk score is normalized to a 0-1 scale, with 0 representing no risk and 1 representing the maximum possible risk.

Risk Breakdown by Category:
- The risk breakdown by category provides insight into the relative contribution of different risk factors to the overall risk profile.
- By analyzing the risk scores for each category, users can identify the key drivers of risk and focus their risk mitigation efforts accordingly.

Risk Status:
- The risk status classification (High Risk or Low Risk) is determined based on a predefined risk threshold.
- The risk threshold is a configurable parameter that can be adjusted based on the organization's risk appetite and regulatory requirements.
- A "High Risk" status indicates that the total risk score exceeds the risk threshold and requires immediate attention and action.
- A "Low Risk" status suggests that the total risk score is within an acceptable range, but ongoing monitoring and periodic reviews are still recommended.

It is important to note that the interpretation of the model's outputs should be done in the context of the model's intended purpose, scope, and limitations, as outlined in the Introduction section. Users should also be aware of any assumptions or constraints that may affect the validity or applicability of the model's results.
