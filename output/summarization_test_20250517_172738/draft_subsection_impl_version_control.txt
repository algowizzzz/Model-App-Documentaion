4.4. Code Version Control

The codebase for this model is managed using a version control system, specifically Git. The Git repository serves as the central source of truth for the model's code and ensures proper version tracking, collaboration, and change management.

Branching Strategy
The development team follows a Git branching strategy to facilitate parallel development, feature experimentation, and controlled merging of changes. The main branch, typically named "main" or "master", represents the stable, production-ready version of the codebase. Feature development and bug fixes are carried out on separate feature branches, which are then merged into the main branch after thorough testing and review.

The branching strategy includes the following key elements:

1. **Main Branch**: The main branch is the primary branch that contains the latest stable version of the codebase. All production-ready code is merged into this branch.

2. **Feature Branches**: For each new feature or bug fix, the developers create a dedicated feature branch off the main branch. These branches are named using a consistent naming convention, such as "feature/new-risk-factor" or "bugfix/incorrect-pfe-calculation".

3. **Merge Requests/Pull Requests**: When a feature or bug fix is ready for integration, the developer creates a merge request (also known as a pull request) to merge the feature branch into the main branch. This triggers a review process, where other team members can examine the changes, provide feedback, and approve the merge.

4. **Merge Restrictions**: The main branch is protected, and direct pushes to this branch are not allowed. All changes must go through the merge request process to ensure code quality and maintain the stability of the production environment.

5. **Commit Messages**: The team follows a consistent convention for writing commit messages, which include a brief summary of the changes, references to any related issues or tickets, and relevant context to aid in understanding the history of the codebase.

6. **Versioning**: The codebase follows a semantic versioning scheme, where the version number is structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. This versioning system helps track and communicate the scope of changes between releases.

Code Review and Collaboration
The version control system, along with the branching strategy, enables effective collaboration among the development team. All code changes go through a review process, where team members can provide feedback, suggest improvements, and ensure the code meets the project's quality standards.

The review process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Merge Request Creation**: When a developer completes a feature or bug fix, they create a merge request in the Git repository, detailing the changes and any relevant context.

2. **Code Review**: Other team members, typically including senior developers or subject matter experts, review the proposed changes. They examine the code, provide feedback, and ensure the changes align with the project's requirements, coding standards, and best practices.

3. **Approval and Merging**: Once the changes have been reviewed and approved, the merge request is merged into the main branch, integrating the new functionality or bug fix into the codebase.

This collaborative review process helps maintain code quality, identify potential issues, and promote knowledge sharing among the development team.

Continuous Integration and Deployment
The version control system is also integrated with the project's continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines. Whenever a new commit is pushed to the main branch, the CI pipeline is triggered, which automatically builds, test, and packages the application. If the build and tests pass, the CD pipeline is then triggered to deploy the updated codebase to the production environment.

This automated process ensures that the latest stable version of the codebase is consistently deployed, reducing the risk of manual errors and promoting a reliable and efficient release management workflow.

Backup and Disaster Recovery
The Git repository is hosted on a secure, cloud-based platform, which provides regular backups and disaster recovery capabilities. In the event of a system failure or data loss, the codebase can be easily restored from the backup repository, ensuring the continuity of the model's development and deployment.

Conclusion
The version control practices employed for this model's codebase, including the Git-based branching strategy, code review process, and continuous integration/deployment, contribute to the overall quality, maintainability, and reliability of the model. These practices align with industry best practices and support the model's development, deployment, and ongoing evolution.
