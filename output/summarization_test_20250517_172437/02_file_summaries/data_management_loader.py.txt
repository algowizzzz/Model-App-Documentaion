SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file, `data_management/loader.py`, is to provide a set of functions and a configuration management class for loading and managing various data files required by the broader model or system.
   - This file plays a crucial role in the data management and initialization aspects of the application, ensuring that necessary input data is properly loaded and made available to other components of the system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**

   - **load_json_data(file_path: str):**
     - Purpose: Loads data from a JSON file located at the specified `file_path`.
     - Key Operations: Checks if the file exists, reads the contents, and parses the JSON data.
     - Inputs: The file path of the JSON file to be loaded.
     - Outputs: The parsed data from the JSON file.

   - **get_trades(config_dir: str = "config"):**
     - Purpose: Loads the trade data from the "trades.json" file located in the specified `config_dir`.
     - Key Operations: Calls `load_json_data()` with the appropriate file path.
     - Inputs: The directory where the configuration files are located (default is "config").
     - Outputs: The trade data loaded from the JSON file.

   - **get_market_data(config_dir: str = "config"):**
     - Purpose: Loads the market data from the "market_data.json" file located in the specified `config_dir`.
     - Key Operations: Calls `load_json_data()` with the appropriate file path.
     - Inputs: The directory where the configuration files are located (default is "config").
     - Outputs: The market data loaded from the JSON file.

   - **get_simulation_params(config_dir: str = "config"):**
     - Purpose: Loads the simulation parameters from the "simulation_params.json" file located in the specified `config_dir`.
     - Key Operations: Calls `load_json_data()` with the appropriate file path.
     - Inputs: The directory where the configuration files are located (default is "config").
     - Outputs: The simulation parameters loaded from the JSON file.

   - **ConfigManager:**
     - Purpose: A simple class to manage the loading and storage of all configuration data required by the system.
     - Key Operations:
       - Initializes with the specified `config_dir` (default is "config").
       - Provides a `load_all()` method to load all configuration files (trades, market data, and simulation parameters).
     - Inputs: The directory where the configuration files are located (default is "config").
     - Outputs: The loaded configuration data is stored as instance attributes (`trades`, `market_data`, `sim_params`).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The primary logic in this file is the implementation of the `load_json_data()` function, which handles the loading and parsing of JSON data files. This function includes error handling for common scenarios, such as file not found and JSON decoding errors.
   - The `ConfigManager` class provides a centralized way to manage the loading and storage of all configuration data required by the system, simplifying the process of accessing this data from other parts of the application.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file primarily works with Python dictionaries to represent the loaded JSON data, as this is the natural data structure for handling JSON-formatted data.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This file does not have any direct internal dependencies, as it is a standalone module responsible for data loading and configuration management.
   - **External:** The file relies on the built-in `json` and `os` modules from the Python standard library.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `load_json_data()` function includes explicit error handling using try-except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions, such as `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
   - The function also includes a general `Exception` block to handle any unexpected errors that may occur during the data loading process.
   - The file utilizes print statements to provide basic logging functionality, informing the user about the success or failure of the data loading operations.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
