1.1. Purpose of the Model

The primary purpose of this model is to implement a comprehensive risk calculation and reporting system. The model is designed to address the critical business need of assessing and managing the risk exposure associated with various financial instruments and portfolios.

The key objectives of this model are:

1. **Risk Factor Calculation**: The model provides the capability to define and calculate the impact of individual risk factors. Each risk factor is represented by the `RiskFactor` class, which captures the name, weight, value, and category of the risk factor. The model allows for the aggregation and analysis of these risk factors to derive a holistic risk assessment.

2. **Risk Score Calculation**: The `RiskCalculator` class is the core component responsible for calculating the total risk score based on the provided list of risk factors. It performs a weighted sum of the risk factors, normalizing the total impact to a 0-1 scale. The model also provides the ability to break down the risk scores by category, enabling a more granular understanding of the risk profile.

3. **Risk Reporting**: The `create_risk_report` function generates a comprehensive risk report based on the `RiskCalculator` instance. The report includes the total risk score, the breakdown of risk by category, and the overall risk status (high-risk or low-risk) based on a predefined risk threshold.

The primary use cases for this model include:

- **Regulatory Capital Calculation**: The risk calculation and reporting capabilities of this model can be leveraged to determine the regulatory capital requirements for specific trade types or portfolios, as mandated by various financial regulations.
- **Portfolio Risk Management**: The model can be used to assess the overall risk exposure of a financial portfolio, enabling risk managers to make informed decisions about portfolio composition, hedging strategies, and risk mitigation measures.
- **Counterparty Credit Risk Assessment**: The risk factors and calculations provided by this model can be utilized to evaluate the credit risk associated with specific counterparties, supporting credit risk management and exposure monitoring.

By providing a robust and flexible risk calculation and reporting framework, this model serves as a critical component within a broader system or application focused on risk management, regulatory compliance, and portfolio optimization.
