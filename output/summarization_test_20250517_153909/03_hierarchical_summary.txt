Based on the provided file summaries, the codebase appears to consist of the following main components and their relationships:

1. **Risk Calculation System**
   - **Purpose:** Implements a comprehensive risk assessment system by combining multiple risk factors.
   - **Core Module:** `complex_module.py`
     - **Key Components:**
       - `RiskFactor` (class): Represents an individual risk factor with its attributes (name, weight, value, category).
       - `RiskCalculator` (class): Calculates the overall risk score by aggregating weighted impacts of risk factors. Provides methods for calculating total risk, generating risk breakdown by category, and validating risk factor inputs.
       - `create_risk_report` (function): Generates a comprehensive risk report dictionary containing total risk, risk breakdown, risk status, and timestamp.
     - **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
       - Weighted sum calculation for overall risk score.
       - Risk breakdown calculation by summing weighted impacts of factors within each category.
     - **Dependencies:** `typing`, `dataclasses`, `datetime`

2. **Configuration Management**
   - **Purpose:** Provides centralized configuration settings and metadata for the project.
   - **Core Module:** `config.json`
     - **Key Components:**
       - JSON object containing configuration settings and dependencies.
     - **Dependencies:** Lists two internal dependencies, "module1" and "module2".

3. **Testing and Demonstration**
   - **Purpose:** Includes a test JavaScript file for verifying the handling of non-Python files within the codebase.
   - **Core Module:** `app.js`
     - **Key Components:**
       - `TestClass`: A class with a method to double a given value.
       - `testFunction`: A function that concatenates two strings.
     - **Dependencies:** None.

**Overall Architecture and Design Patterns:**

The codebase appears to follow a modular design, where each file or module serves a specific purpose within the broader system. The `complex_module.py` file implements the core risk calculation logic, utilizing classes and functions to encapsulate the related functionality. The `config.json` file provides a centralized configuration management approach, allowing different components to access and utilize the defined settings and dependencies.

The inclusion of the `app.js` file suggests that the codebase may be part of a larger project or system that supports multiple programming languages or environments. However, the specific details of how these components interact or integrate with each other are not provided in the file summaries.

No explicit design patterns are mentioned in the summaries, but the use of classes (`RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator`) in `complex_module.py` suggests an object-oriented programming approach. Additionally, the separation of concerns between risk calculation logic and configuration management indicates a modular design principle.

**Relationships and Dependencies:**

- The `complex_module.py` file appears to be a core component of the risk calculation system, potentially utilized by other parts of the codebase or integrated into a larger financial risk management or portfolio analysis system.
- The `config.json` file is likely consumed by various components or modules within the project, providing them with the necessary configuration settings and dependencies.
- The `app.js` file seems to be a standalone test or demonstration file and does not have any explicit dependencies or relationships with the other files mentioned in the summaries.

It's important to note that the provided information is limited, and the actual relationships and dependencies between different parts of the codebase may be more complex or involve additional components not covered in the file summaries.
