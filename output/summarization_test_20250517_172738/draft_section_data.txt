3. Data

This section provides a comprehensive description of the data used by the model, including the sources, specifications, transformations, and quality assessment processes.

3.1. Input Data Sources and Specifications
The model utilizes several input data elements from various sources, which are detailed as follows:

- Trade Data: The model ingests trade data from the internal "Trades" database, which is updated on a daily basis. The specific data elements include trade ID, trade type, trade date, counterparty, notional amount, and other relevant trade attributes. This data is provided in a JSON format, as specified in the "trades.json" configuration file.
- Market Data: The model requires real-time market data, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. This data is sourced from the external "Market Data" vendor feed, which provides the data in a CSV format on an hourly basis. The specific data elements and their formats are defined in the "market_data.json" configuration file.
- Reference Data: The model also utilizes reference data, such as product master data and counterparty information, from the internal "Reference Data" database. This data is provided in a relational database format and is updated on a weekly basis.

3.2. Data Preprocessing and Transformations
The raw input data undergoes several preprocessing and transformation steps before being used by the model:

- Trade Data Cleaning: The trade data is cleaned to handle any missing or erroneous values. Specifically, trades with incomplete or invalid counterparty information are filtered out, and any trades with negative notional amounts are flagged for further investigation.
- Market Data Imputation: For instances where the market data feed is delayed or unavailable, the model applies linear interpolation to impute the missing values based on the most recent available data.
- Reference Data Enrichment: The reference data is joined with the trade and market data to enrich the model's input with additional attributes, such as product characteristics and counterparty credit ratings.
- Data Normalization: All input data elements are normalized to a common scale and units to ensure consistent treatment within the model's calculations.

3.3. Data Quality Assessment
The model employs several processes to assess the quality of the input data and handle any issues that may arise:

- Validation Checks: Automated validation checks are performed on the input data to identify any missing, out-of-range, or anomalous values. These checks are defined in the model's configuration settings and are executed as part of the data preprocessing pipeline.
- Anomaly Detection: The model monitors the input data streams for any significant deviations from historical patterns or expected ranges. Anomalies are flagged, and the model's risk calculations are adjusted accordingly to account for potential data quality issues.
- Data Lineage Tracking: The model maintains a detailed data lineage, tracking the flow of data from its original sources through the various transformation and enrichment steps. This lineage information is used to investigate the root causes of any data quality issues that may arise.
- Escalation Procedures: In the event of persistent or severe data quality problems, the model triggers escalation procedures to notify the relevant data stewards and risk management teams. These teams then work to resolve the data issues or implement appropriate mitigating actions.

3.4. Data Lineage
The flow of data within the model can be conceptually described as follows:

1. The trade data is extracted from the internal "Trades" database and undergoes the cleaning and enrichment steps described in Section 3.2.
2. The market data is sourced from the external "Market Data" vendor feed and is imputed and normalized as part of the data preprocessing.
3. The reference data is retrieved from the internal "Reference Data" database and joined with the trade and market data to provide additional context and attributes.
4. The preprocessed and transformed data is then used as input to the model's risk calculation and reporting components, as described in the "Complex Module" section of the codebase summary.
5. The model's outputs, such as the risk reports, are generated based on the processed data and are made available to the intended users.

This data lineage ensures transparency and traceability of the information used by the model, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and audit purposes.
