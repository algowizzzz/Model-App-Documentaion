File: simulation_engine/gbm_model.py

**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
This file contains an implementation of the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices over time. Its primary purpose is to provide a reusable component for generating multiple paths of asset price trajectories based on the GBM stochastic process. This file is likely a part of a larger financial modeling or risk management system, serving as a simulation engine component for asset price evolution under the GBM assumption.

- **Class: GBMProcess**
    - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the GBM process for simulating asset prices.
    - **Key Operations:**
        - Initializes the GBM process with given parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta).
        - Generates multiple asset price paths over specified time steps using the GBM equation.
    - **Inputs:**
        - Initial asset price (S0), drift rate (mu), volatility (sigma), and time delta (dt).

     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes the TRS contract with trade details (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Calculates the MtM values for a given set of underlying price paths.
       - Calculates the exposure values from the MtM values.
     - **Inputs:**
       - Trade details dictionary (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Array of current underlying price paths (time steps, num paths).
     - **Outputs:**
       - MtM values array (time steps, num paths).
       - Exposure values array (time steps, num paths).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The MtM calculation is based on the change in the underlying equity price relative to the initial price at inception, multiplied by the notional amount. The calculation is adjusted for the trade type (receiver or payer).
   - The exposure calculation simply takes the maximum of 0 and the MtM values, assuming positive MtM means the counterparty owes the TRS holder.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure is a NumPy array representing the underlying price paths, with shape (num_time_steps + 1, num_paths).
   - The trade details are stored in a Python dictionary.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy library for numerical operations and array manipulation.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `__init__` method raises a `ValueError` if the `trade_type` is invalid.
   - The file uses `print` statements to log the creation of the TRS instrument and the MtM calculation process, which could be replaced with a proper logging library in a production environment.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that the funding leg (fixed or floating rate payments) of the TRS is netted against the equity leg at each valuation date, focusing solely on the change in equity value.
   - The exposure calculation assumes that positive MtM values indicate the counterparty owes the TRS holder, which may not hold true in all cases or under different assumptions.
   - The file does not handle any potential exceptions or edge cases beyond the `trade_type` validation, such as handling zero or negative initial prices.

File: pfe_calculation/pfe_computer.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to provide a class for calculating the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) at a given quantile from a set of exposure paths.
   - This file appears to be a standalone component responsible for a specific calculation step within a broader risk management or counterparty credit risk modeling system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **PFEQuantileCalculator** (class)
     - **Purpose:** Calculate the PFE profile (a vector of PFE values over time) at a specified quantile from exposure paths.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes with a quantile value between 0 and 1.
       - Calculates the PFE at each time step as the specified quantile of positive exposures across paths.
       - Ensures PFE values are non-negative.
     - **Inputs:** A 2D NumPy array representing exposure paths, with shape (num_time_steps + 1, num_paths).
     - **Outputs:** A 1D NumPy array representing the PFE profile over time, with shape (num_time_steps + 1,).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The core algorithm used is the calculation of the quantile of positive exposures across paths at each time step using NumPy's `np.percentile` function.
   - The quantile is specified as a percentage (e.g., 95 for the 95th percentile) based on the provided quantile value.
   - The calculation is performed along the axis representing paths (axis=1) to obtain the quantile for each time step.
   - A maximum operation with 0 is applied to ensure non-negative PFE values.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure used is a 2D NumPy array to represent exposure paths, with rows representing time steps and columns representing individual paths.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **External:** NumPy (for array operations and quantile calculation).

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - A `ValueError` is raised if the input `exposure_paths` array is not 2D.
   - A `ValueError` is raised if the provided quantile is not between 0 and 1 (exclusive).
   - Print statements are used for logging initialization and successful PFE profile calculation.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The code assumes that the input `exposure_paths` array has a specific shape, with the first row representing exposures at time 0 (usually 0).
   - The code assumes that exposures are non-negative values, as it applies a maximum operation with 0 to ensure non-negative PFE values.
   - The code does not handle any potential exceptions or errors beyond the specified `ValueError` cases.
   - The code does not provide any functionality for generating or simulating exposure paths; it assumes these are provided as input.

File: pfe_calculation/exposure_aggregator.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to provide functionality for aggregating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades.
   - Within the broader model or system, this file likely serves as a component responsible for consolidating and combining PFE calculations from individual trades into an aggregated portfolio-level view.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **TradeAggregator** (class)
     - **Purpose:** Manages the aggregation of PFE profiles across multiple trades.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Stores individual trade PFE profiles in a dictionary.
       - Provides a method to retrieve all stored individual PFE profiles.
       - Implements a simple summation method to aggregate PFE profiles across trades.
     - **Inputs:** Trade ID (string) and corresponding PFE profile (NumPy array).
     - **Outputs:** Dictionary of individual trade PFE profiles, aggregated PFE profile (NumPy array).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method implements a basic aggregation approach by summing the PFE profiles of all trades. It checks for consistent profile lengths and performs a NumPy array summation across trades.
   - The method acknowledges that this simple summation is generally not how portfolio PFE is calculated due to netting effects, but serves as a basic example.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure used is a Python dictionary (`self.all_trade_pfe_profiles`) to store individual trade PFE profiles, with trade IDs as keys and NumPy arrays as values.
   - NumPy arrays are used to represent PFE profiles.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy library for numerical operations and array manipulation.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `add_trade_pfe_profile` method prints a warning if attempting to overwrite an existing PFE profile for a trade ID.
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method raises a `ValueError` if the PFE profiles have different lengths, preventing incorrect summation.
   - The file uses standard `print` statements for logging and status updates.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that PFE profiles are represented as NumPy arrays of consistent length across trades.
   - The simple summation approach implemented in `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` is acknowledged as a limitation, as it does not account for netting effects in portfolio PFE calculation.
   - The file does not implement more complex aggregation methods, such as netting or advanced portfolio PFE calculations, as stated in the class docstring.
