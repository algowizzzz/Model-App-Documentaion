2.2. Mathematical Formulation

This section presents the key mathematical formulations, algorithms, and logical steps involved in the model's calculations. It defines all relevant variables and parameters.

The model's core functionality is implemented in the `complex_module.py` file, which defines the `RiskFactor` class and the `RiskCalculator` class. These components handle the calculation and aggregation of risk scores based on a set of risk factors.

2.2.1. Risk Factor Representation
The `RiskFactor` class represents a single risk factor, with the following attributes:
- `name`: The name or identifier of the risk factor.
- `weight`: The weight or importance of the risk factor, a value between 0 and 1.
- `value`: The numerical value of the risk factor, which must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `category`: The category or type of the risk factor.

The weighted impact of a risk factor is calculated as:
```
weighted_impact = weight * value
```

2.2.2. Risk Calculation and Aggregation
The `RiskCalculator` class is responsible for the overall risk calculation and aggregation process. It takes a list of `RiskFactor` instances as input and performs the following steps:

1. **Total Risk Score Calculation**:
   - The total risk score is calculated as the sum of the weighted impacts of all risk factors:
     ```
     total_risk_score = sum(risk_factor.weighted_impact for risk_factor in risk_factors)
     ```
   - The total risk score is then normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing it by the sum of all risk factor weights.

2. **Risk Breakdown by Category**:
   - The `get_risk_breakdown` method calculates the risk score for each category by summing the weighted impacts of the risk factors within each category.
   - The risk breakdown is returned as a dictionary, where the keys are the category names, and the values are the corresponding risk scores.

3. **Risk Factor Validation**:
   - The `_validate_factors` method checks the risk factors for any invalid weights or values. It returns a list of validation error messages, if any.

2.2.3. Risk Report Generation
The `create_risk_report` function takes a `RiskCalculator` instance as input and generates a comprehensive risk report. The report includes the following information:
- Timestamp of the report generation
- Total risk score
- Risk breakdown by category
- Risk status (high-risk or low-risk) based on a predefined risk threshold

The risk report is returned as a dictionary with the following structure:
```
{
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "total_risk": total_risk_score,
    "risk_breakdown": risk_breakdown,
    "status": "high-risk" if total_risk_score > risk_threshold else "low-risk"
}
```

The mathematical formulations and algorithms described above provide the core logic for calculating and aggregating risk scores based on a set of risk factors. The `RiskFactor` class represents the individual risk factors, the `RiskCalculator` class handles the overall risk calculation and breakdown, and the `create_risk_report` function generates a comprehensive risk report.

[Information regarding the specific risk threshold used in the risk status determination needs to be sourced/further investigated as it is not fully available in the provided codebase summaries.]
