SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file, `monte_carlo_simulator.py`, is to provide a Monte Carlo simulation engine for generating price paths for various assets.
   - This file is a key component within the broader `simulation_engine` module, responsible for the core simulation functionality required for Potential Future Exposure (PFE) calculations.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**

   - **Class: `MonteCarloEngine`**
     - **Purpose:** Orchestrates the Monte Carlo simulations for different assets.
     - **Key Operations:** Initializes the simulation parameters, runs the asset price path simulations using the `GBMProcess` class, and returns the simulated price paths.
     - **Inputs:** A dictionary of simulation parameters, including the number of paths to simulate, and a dictionary of asset market data (current price, risk-free rate, dividend yield, volatility).
     - **Outputs:** A numpy array containing the simulated price paths for the asset.

   - **Function: `run_asset_simulation`**
     - **Purpose:** Simulates the price paths for a single asset using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process.
     - **Key Operations:** Calculates the drift term based on the risk-free rate and dividend yield, creates a `GBMProcess` instance, and generates the price paths.
     - **Inputs:** A dictionary of asset market data and the total number of time steps and time delta for the simulation.
     - **Outputs:** A numpy array containing the simulated price paths for the asset.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The primary algorithm implemented in this file is the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process, which is used to generate the simulated price paths for the assets. The GBM process is a widely used model for simulating the behavior of asset prices, particularly in the context of financial risk management and derivatives pricing.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file primarily uses dictionaries to represent the simulation parameters and asset market data.
   - The simulated price paths are returned as a numpy array.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This file depends on the `GBMProcess` class defined in the `gbm_model.py` file within the same `simulation_engine` module.
   - **External:** The file utilizes the numpy library for numerical computations and array manipulation.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The file includes basic logging functionality, using the `print` statements to output information about the initialization of the `MonteCarloEngine` and the completion of the asset simulation.
   - No explicit error handling mechanisms are observed in the provided code.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - The code assumes that the input `asset_market_data` dictionary contains the necessary information (current price, risk-free rate, dividend yield, volatility) required for the GBM simulation.
   - The implementation assumes that the `GBMProcess` class correctly generates the price paths based on the provided parameters.
   - The file does not handle any potential errors or edge cases that may arise during the simulation process.
