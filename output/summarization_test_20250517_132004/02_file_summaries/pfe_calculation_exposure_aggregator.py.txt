1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to provide functionality for aggregating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades.
   - Within the broader model or system, this file likely plays a role in calculating and reporting portfolio-level risk metrics, specifically related to counterparty credit risk and exposure management.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **Class: TradeAggregator**
     - **Purpose:** Aggregates PFE profiles across multiple trades.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Stores individual trade PFE profiles in a dictionary.
       - Implements a simple summation method for aggregating PFE profiles.
     - **Inputs:**
       - `trade_id` (str): Unique identifier for a trade.
       - `pfe_profile` (numpy.ndarray): PFE profile for a specific trade.
     - **Outputs:**
       - `all_trade_pfe_profiles` (dict): Dictionary containing individual trade PFE profiles.
       - `aggregated_pfe_profile` (numpy.ndarray): Aggregated PFE profile across all trades.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method implements a basic aggregation approach by summing the PFE profiles of all trades at each time step.
   - This method includes a check to ensure that all PFE profiles have the same length before summation.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The `all_trade_pfe_profiles` dictionary stores individual trade PFE profiles, with trade IDs as keys and numpy arrays as values.
   - The `aggregated_pfe_profile` attribute is a numpy array representing the aggregated PFE profile across all trades.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **External:** The file imports the `numpy` library for working with numerical arrays.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `add_trade_pfe_profile` method prints a warning message if a PFE profile for a trade ID is being overwritten.
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method raises a `ValueError` if the PFE profiles have different lengths.
   - The file uses `print` statements for logging various events and messages.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that PFE profiles are represented as numpy arrays of equal length across all trades.
   - The simple summation approach implemented in `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` is noted as generally not being the correct way to calculate portfolio PFE due to netting effects, and is provided as a basic example.
   - The file does not implement more complex aggregation methods, such as netting or considering portfolio effects, which are mentioned as being out of scope for this "bare-minimum" example.
