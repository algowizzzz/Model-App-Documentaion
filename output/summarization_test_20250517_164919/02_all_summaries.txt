     - The file does not handle more complex Equity TRS structures, such as those with multiple underlying assets, exotic payoff structures, or additional features like collateralization or netting.
     - The file assumes that the underlying price paths are provided as input and does not include any functionality for generating or simulating these price paths.

File: pfe_calculation/pfe_computer.py

SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file, `pfe_calculation/pfe_computer.py`, is to provide a class `PFEQuantileCalculator` that calculates the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profile at a given quantile based on a set of exposure paths.
   - This file is a key component within the broader model or system, as it encapsulates the core logic for computing the PFE, which is a crucial risk metric used in various financial applications.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - `PFEQuantileCalculator` class:
     - **Purpose:** Calculates the PFE profile at a specified quantile from a set of exposure paths.
     - **Key Operations:** Computes the quantile of positive exposures across paths for each time step, resulting in the PFE profile.
     - **Inputs:** An array of exposure values, where each row represents the exposures at a specific time step and each column represents a different path.
     - **Outputs:** A numpy array representing the PFE profile, where each element corresponds to the PFE value at a specific time step.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The core algorithm implemented in this file is the calculation of the PFE profile using the `np.percentile` function. This function is used to compute the specified quantile of the positive exposures across all paths for each time step, resulting in the PFE profile.
   - The logic also ensures that the PFE values are non-negative, even though the percentile of non-negative exposures should already be non-negative.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure used in this file is a 2D numpy array `exposure_paths`, which represents the exposure values over time and across multiple paths.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This file does not have any direct dependencies on other modules, classes, or functions within the codebase.
   - **External:** This file relies on the `numpy` library for numerical operations, such as computing the percentile of exposure values.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The file includes explicit error handling by raising a `ValueError` if the provided quantile is not between 0 and 1 (exclusive).
   - The file also includes logging functionality, where it prints messages to indicate the initialization of the `PFEQuantileCalculator` and the successful calculation of the PFE profile.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - Assumptions:
     - The input `exposure_paths` array is a 2D numpy array with the first dimension representing the time steps and the second dimension representing the paths.
     - The first row of the `exposure_paths` array (i.e., `exposure_paths[0,:]`) represents the exposures at time step 0, which are typically assumed to be 0.
   - Limitations:
     - The file does not handle cases where the input `exposure_paths` array has a different shape or dimensionality than expected.
     - The file does not provide any functionality for handling missing or invalid data in the input `exposure_paths` array.

File: pfe_calculation/exposure_aggregator.py

SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file, `exposure_aggregator.py`, is to provide a mechanism for aggregating and managing Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades.
   - This file is a key component within the broader `pfe_calculation` module, responsible for the specific task of consolidating and summarizing individual trade-level PFE profiles into a single aggregated PFE profile.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **`TradeAggregator` Class:**
     - **Purpose:** Aggregates PFE profiles across multiple trades.
     - **Key Operations:** Stores individual trade PFE profiles, calculates a simple sum of all profiles, and provides access to the aggregated PFE profile.
     - **Inputs:** Trade IDs and corresponding PFE profiles (as NumPy arrays).
     - **Outputs:** The aggregated PFE profile (as a NumPy array).
   - **`add_trade_pfe_profile()`:**
     - **Purpose:** Stores the PFE profile for a single trade.
     - **Key Operations:** Adds the provided PFE profile to the internal dictionary of all trade PFE profiles.
     - **Inputs:** Trade ID and PFE profile (as a NumPy array).
     - **Outputs:** None.
   - **`get_all_individual_pfe_profiles()`:**
     - **Purpose:** Provides access to the dictionary of all stored individual trade PFE profiles.
     - **Key Operations:** Returns the internal dictionary of all trade PFE profiles.
     - **Inputs:** None.
     - **Outputs:** A dictionary of trade IDs and their corresponding PFE profiles.
   - **`calculate_simple_sum_pfe()`:**
     - **Purpose:** Calculates a simple sum of all stored individual trade PFE profiles.
     - **Key Operations:** Sums the PFE profiles of all trades, ensuring they have the same length.
     - **Inputs:** None.
     - **Outputs:** The aggregated PFE profile (as a NumPy array).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The primary logic implemented in this file is the `calculate_simple_sum_pfe()` method, which performs a simple summation of all stored individual trade PFE profiles. This is a basic aggregation approach, as the actual calculation of portfolio-level PFE would typically involve more complex netting effects, which are out of the scope of this "bare-minimum" example.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The `TradeAggregator` class maintains an internal dictionary `all_trade_pfe_profiles` to store the individual trade PFE profiles, using trade IDs as keys and NumPy arrays as values.
   - The `aggregated_pfe_profile` attribute is a placeholder for a more complex aggregation, which is not implemented in this example.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This file does not have any direct dependencies on other modules within the `pfe_calculation` codebase.
   - **External:** The file utilizes the `numpy` library for working with NumPy arrays.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `add_trade_pfe_profile()` method logs a warning message if a PFE profile is being overwritten for a given trade ID.
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe()` method raises a `ValueError` if the PFE profiles being aggregated have different lengths.
   - The file uses basic print statements for logging purposes, such as when the `TradeAggregator` is initialized and when PFE profiles are added or aggregated.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - This file assumes that the input PFE profiles are provided as NumPy arrays of the same length.
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe()` method implements a basic summation of PFE profiles, which is not the correct way to calculate portfolio-level PFE due to netting effects. This limitation is explicitly mentioned in the docstring.
   - The file does not handle more complex aggregation scenarios, such as netting, which are out of the scope of this "
