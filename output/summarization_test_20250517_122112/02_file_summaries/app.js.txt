The provided file `app.js` is a test JavaScript file that demonstrates the handling of non-Python files in a parseable manner. The main purpose of this file is to showcase the usage of JavaScript classes, functions, and module exports.

The key components of this file are:

1. `TestClass`: A JavaScript class that has a constructor to initialize an instance with a `value` property. It also includes a method `doubleValue` that takes a number as input and returns the doubled value. This method is documented using JSDoc comments.

2. `testFunction`: A JavaScript function that takes two parameters (`param1` and `param2`, with `param2` having a default value of "default"). It returns a string concatenation of the two parameters.

3. `module.exports`: An object that exports both `TestClass` and `testFunction`, making them available for use in other parts of the application or by external modules.

The file does not have any notable algorithms or design patterns implemented. However, it demonstrates the use of JavaScript classes, functions, and module exports, which are fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming.

The file does not have any external dependencies or relationships with other files or modules. It is a self-contained unit that can be imported and used in other parts of the application or by external modules through the exported components.

Overall, this file serves as a simple example of JavaScript code structure, showcasing the use of classes, functions, and module exports, while also demonstrating the handling of non-Python files in a parseable manner.
