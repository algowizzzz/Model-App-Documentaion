3. Data

This section provides a comprehensive description of the data used by the model, including the sources, specifications, transformations, and quality assessment.

3.1. Input Data Sources and Specifications
The model utilizes the following key input data elements:

- `config.json`: This file stores project-level configuration settings and dependencies, including parameters such as debug mode, maximum retries, and timeout.
- `data.xml`: This file represents structured data related to persons, including their names, ages, and skills. It serves as a data source for loading and accessing person-related information.
- `query.sql`: This SQL query retrieves user data from a database table, including the user's name and email address. The query filters the results to include only users created within the last 7 days.

The input data is sourced from a combination of internal databases, configuration files, and external data feeds. The frequency of data updates varies, with the `config.json` and `data.xml` files being static, while the user data from the SQL query is refreshed on a weekly basis.

3.2. Data Preprocessing and Transformations
The model does not perform any significant data preprocessing or transformation steps. The input data is used in its raw form, with the following exceptions:

- The `config.json` file is parsed to extract the relevant configuration parameters, such as the debug mode, maximum retries, and timeout.
- The `data.xml` file is parsed to extract the person-related information, including the name, age, and skills for each individual.
- The SQL query results are fetched and the user data is extracted from the returned rows.

No additional cleaning, filtering, or imputation steps are applied to the raw data before it is used by the model.

3.3. Data Quality Assessment
The model relies on the following processes to assess the quality of the input data:

- **Config.json Validation**: The model checks that the configuration parameters defined in the `config.json` file are within the expected ranges and types (e.g., debug mode is a boolean, maximum retries is a positive integer, timeout is a positive integer).
- **Data.xml Validation**: The model verifies that the `data.xml` file contains the expected structure, with each `person` element having the required `name`, `age`, and `skills` sub-elements.
- **SQL Query Validation**: The model checks that the SQL query returns the expected columns (name and email) and that the filtering by creation date is working as intended.

If any issues are detected during these validation checks, the model logs the corresponding error messages and handles the invalid or missing data accordingly. For example, if the `config.json` file is missing a required parameter, the model will use a default value and log a warning. If the `data.xml` file is malformed, the model will skip processing that data and log an error.

3.4. Data Lineage
The flow of data within the model can be conceptually described as follows:

1. The `config.json` file is loaded and parsed to extract the necessary configuration parameters.
2. The `data.xml` file is loaded and parsed to extract the person-related information.
3. The SQL query is executed against the database to retrieve the user data.
4. The extracted data from the `config.json`, `data.xml`, and SQL query is then used by the various components of the model, such as the `RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator` classes, to perform the risk assessment calculations.
5. The model's outputs, such as the risk report generated by the `create_risk_report` function, are then made available for further use or reporting.

The model does not maintain any persistent storage or caching of the input data. Each time the model is executed, the data is fetched from the respective sources.
