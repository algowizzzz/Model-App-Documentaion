I'm afraid I cannot provide a detailed summary for the given file as it is empty. The file `financial_instruments/__init__.py` does not contain any code or functionality to analyze. Without any content in the file, I do not have enough information to generate the requested documentation. Please provide a non-empty file for me to analyze and summarize.
