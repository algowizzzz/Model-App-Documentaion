DRAFT SECTION: 1. Introduction (ID: introduction)

1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide comprehensive documentation for the BMO Risk Calculation Model, a critical component within the bank's broader risk management framework. This introduction section outlines the key objectives, scope, and context of the model, setting the stage for the detailed technical information that follows.

1.1. Purpose of the Model
The BMO Risk Calculation Model is designed to address the fundamental business need of accurately assessing and reporting on the risk profile of BMO's trading book and derivatives portfolio. The model's primary objectives are:

- To calculate the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) for specific trade types and portfolios, enabling the bank to meet regulatory capital requirements and manage its overall risk exposure.
- To provide a robust and transparent risk assessment framework that can be used by various stakeholders, including risk managers, traders, and senior executives, to make informed decisions and implement effective risk mitigation strategies.
- To generate comprehensive risk reports that detail the breakdown of risk by category, allowing the bank to identify and address areas of heightened concern.

1.2. Scope and Applicability
The BMO Risk Calculation Model is applicable to the bank's trading book and derivatives portfolio, covering a wide range of asset classes, including interest rate derivatives, foreign exchange contracts, and credit default swaps. The model is designed to handle both vanilla and more complex structured products, providing a consistent and reliable risk assessment across the bank's trading activities.

While the model is primarily focused on PFE calculation, it also has the capability to assess other risk metrics, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Stressed VaR, as required by the bank's risk management practices and regulatory guidelines.

It is important to note that the model does not cover certain specialized or bespoke trade types, such as exotic derivatives or illiquid instruments, as these may require additional customization or a separate modeling approach. The specific exclusions and boundaries of the model's scope are outlined in the "Limitations" section of this documentation.

1.3. Intended Users
The primary users of the BMO Risk Calculation Model and its outputs are:

- Risk Managers: Responsible for monitoring and managing the bank's overall risk exposure, they utilize the model's risk assessments and reports to identify, measure, and mitigate various risk factors.
- Traders and Portfolio Managers: They rely on the model's risk calculations to inform their trading decisions, ensure compliance with risk limits, and optimize the risk-return profile of their portfolios.
- Senior Executives and Regulatory Authorities: The model's risk reports and analysis are used by senior management and regulatory bodies to assess the bank's risk profile, inform strategic decisions, and demonstrate compliance with applicable guidelines and requirements.

1.4. Regulatory Context
The BMO Risk Calculation Model has been designed to adhere to the relevant regulatory guidelines and requirements, including:

- OSFI Guideline E-23: "Margin Requirements for Non-Centrally Cleared Derivatives"
- BCBS 279: "The Standardised Approach for Measuring Counterparty Credit Risk Exposures"
- SR 11-7: "Guidance on Model Risk Management"

The model's methodologies, assumptions, and outputs have been carefully reviewed and validated to ensure compliance with these regulatory frameworks, enabling the bank to meet its reporting obligations and maintain a robust risk management practice.

Overall, the BMO Risk Calculation Model is a critical component of the bank's risk management infrastructure, providing a comprehensive and reliable assessment of the trading book and derivatives portfolio's risk profile. The model's purpose, scope, and intended users, as well as its alignment with regulatory requirements, are the key focus of this introductory section.
