**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
This file contains an implementation of the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices over time. Its primary purpose is to provide a reusable component for generating multiple paths of asset price trajectories, which can be utilized in various financial modeling and simulation tasks, such as option pricing, portfolio analysis, or risk management.

**2. Key Components and Functionality:**
- **Class: GBMProcess**
    - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the GBM process for simulating asset prices.
    - **Key Operations:**
        - Initializes the process with given parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta).
        - Generates multiple asset price paths over a specified number of time steps.
    - **Inputs:**
        - Initial price (float): The starting price of the asset.
        - Drift (float): The expected rate of return (e.g., risk-free rate - dividend yield).
        - Volatility (float): The volatility of the asset price.
        - Time delta (float): The time increment for each step (in years).
        - Number of steps (int): The number of time steps to simulate for each path.
        - Number of paths (int): The number of distinct paths to generate.
    - **Outputs:**
        - numpy.ndarray: An array of shape (num_steps + 1, num_paths) containing the simulated asset prices, including the initial price at t=0.

**3. Core Algorithms and Logic:**
The core algorithm implemented in this file is the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process, which is a widely used stochastic process for modeling asset prices in finance. The GBM process is defined by the following equation:

```
S(t+dt) = S(t) * exp((mu - 0.5 * sigma^2) * dt + sigma * sqrt(dt) * Z)
```

Where:
- `S(t)` is the asset price at time `t`
- `mu` is the drift term (expected rate of return)
- `sigma` is the volatility of the asset price
- `dt` is the time increment
- `Z` is a standard normal random variable

The `generate_paths` method implements this equation to simulate multiple asset price paths over a specified number of time steps. It generates random shocks from a standard normal distribution and iteratively calculates the next asset price based on the previous price, drift, volatility, and random shock.

**4. Data Structures:**
The primary data structure used in this file is a NumPy array to store and manipulate the simulated asset price paths. The `generate_paths` method returns a NumPy array of shape `(num_steps + 1, num_paths)`, where each column represents a distinct asset price path over time.

**5. Dependencies:**
- **Internal:** None (this file appears to be self-contained).
- **External:**
    - NumPy: A fundamental Python library for scientific computing, used for efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.

**6. Error Handling and Logging:**
- Error Handling: The `generate_paths` method includes a check for invalid input values (non-positive `num_steps` or `num_paths`), raising a `ValueError` exception in such cases.
- Logging: The file uses `print` statements to log the initialization parameters and the number of paths generated. However, it does not employ a dedicated logging library or framework.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
- Assumptions:
    - The asset prices follow a Geometric Brownian Motion process, which assumes log-normal price distributions and constant drift and volatility over time.
    - The input parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta) are valid and within reasonable ranges.
- Limitations:
    - The GBM process is a simplified model and may not accurately capture real-world asset price dynamics, which can exhibit more complex behaviors, such as jumps, stochastic volatility, or regime shifts.
    - The implementation does not include any advanced features, such as parallelization or optimizations for large-scale simulations.
    - The file does not provide functionality for analyzing or visualizing the generated asset price paths.
