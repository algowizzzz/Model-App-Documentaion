**SUMMARY:**

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - This file serves as a configuration file for setting up and controlling the parameters of a simulation process.
   - Its role is to provide a centralized location for specifying key simulation settings, which are likely consumed by other components of the broader model or system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - The file does not contain any classes, functions, or methods. It is a JSON file with key-value pairs representing configuration parameters.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - This file does not implement any algorithms or complex logic. It merely stores configuration values.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file uses a JSON object as its data structure, with the following keys and their corresponding values:
     - `"simulation_id"`: A string representing the unique identifier for the simulation run.
     - `"num_paths"`: An integer specifying the number of simulation paths or iterations.
     - `"pfe_quantile"`: A float representing the quantile value for Potential Future Exposure (PFE) calculation.
     - `"output_directory"`: A string indicating the directory path where simulation results will be stored.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This file does not have any explicit internal dependencies on other modules, classes, or functions within the codebase.
   - **External:** This file does not rely on any external libraries or packages.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - This file does not contain any explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities, as it is a configuration file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - **Assumptions:**
     - The values provided in this configuration file are valid and within the expected ranges for the simulation process.
     - The specified `"output_directory"` path is a valid and writable location on the file system.
   - **Limitations:**
     - This file does not provide any validation or error checking for the provided configuration values.
     - The configuration parameters are hard-coded in this file, which may limit flexibility and require code changes for different simulation scenarios.
