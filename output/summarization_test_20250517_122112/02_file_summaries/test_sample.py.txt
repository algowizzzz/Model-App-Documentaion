The provided file `test_sample.py` is a Python script containing various code structures for testing and demonstration purposes. The main purpose of this file is to serve as an example or reference for understanding different Python constructs, such as functions, classes, methods, nested structures, and type hints.

Key components:

1. `simple_function`: A simple function that takes two parameters (`param1` and `param2`) and returns a greeting string. It demonstrates the use of type hints and default parameter values.

2. `TestClass`: A class with an initializer (`__init__`) and two methods:
   - `outer_method`: This method takes a list of integers as input and returns a dictionary containing the sum of the list elements and the original value passed to the class instance. It showcases the use of a nested function (`nested_function`) within a method.
   - `doubled_value`: A property decorator that returns the doubled value of the instance's `value` attribute.

3. `GLOBAL_CONSTANT`: A global variable of type string, which could be used for testing or demonstration purposes.

4. `if __name__ == "__main__":` block: This section contains some test code that creates an instance of `TestClass`, calls the `outer_method` with a list of integers, and prints the result.

Important relationships and dependencies:

- The `simple_function` and `TestClass` are independent components within the file.
- The `outer_method` of `TestClass` depends on the `nested_function` for calculating the sum of the input list.
- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block depends on the `TestClass` and its methods for testing purposes.

Notable algorithms or patterns:

- The file does not implement any complex algorithms or design patterns. However, it demonstrates the use of nested functions (`nested_function` within `outer_method`) and the property decorator (`doubled_value`).

Overall, this file serves as a reference or example for understanding various Python constructs, including functions, classes, methods, nested structures, type hints, and basic testing. It does not contain any complex algorithms or patterns but provides a foundation for learning and experimenting with Python code.
