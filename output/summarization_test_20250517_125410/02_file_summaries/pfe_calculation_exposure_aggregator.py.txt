The `exposure_aggregator.py` file contains a class `TradeAggregator` that is designed to aggregate Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades. The main purpose of this file is to provide a simple implementation for combining PFE profiles, which is a crucial step in calculating portfolio-level risk measures.

The key components of this file are:

1. `TradeAggregator` class:
   - `__init__()`: Initializes the class and creates a dictionary to store individual trade PFE profiles.
   - `add_trade_pfe_profile(trade_id, pfe_profile)`: Stores the PFE profile for a single trade, identified by a `trade_id`.
   - `get_all_individual_pfe_profiles()`: Returns a dictionary containing all stored individual trade PFE profiles.
   - `calculate_simple_sum_pfe()`: Implements a basic aggregation method by summing the PFE profiles of all trades. This method serves as a simple example and is not representative of how portfolio PFE is typically calculated due to netting effects.

The `TradeAggregator` class does not have any external dependencies, except for the `numpy` library, which is used for array operations.

The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe()` method demonstrates a simple algorithm for aggregating PFE profiles by summing the individual trade profiles. However, the code acknowledges that this approach is generally not used in practice due to the need to account for netting effects when calculating portfolio-level PFE.

The file also includes a `main` section that serves as a basic test case for the `TradeAggregator` class, demonstrating how to create an instance, add individual trade PFE profiles, retrieve them, and perform the simple summation aggregation.

Overall, this file provides a basic framework for aggregating PFE profiles across trades, with the potential for future extensions to incorporate more sophisticated aggregation methods that account for netting effects and other portfolio-level considerations.
