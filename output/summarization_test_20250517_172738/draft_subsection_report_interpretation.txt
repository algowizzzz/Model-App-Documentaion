6.2. Interpretation of Results

This section provides guidance on how to interpret the outputs and results generated by the risk calculation model implemented in the `complex_module.py` file.

The primary output of the model is a comprehensive risk report, which is generated by the `create_risk_report` function. This report includes the following key elements:

1. **Total Risk Score**: The model calculates a total risk score by aggregating the weighted impacts of all the individual risk factors. This score is normalized to a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 represents no risk and 1 represents the maximum possible risk.

2. **Risk Breakdown by Category**: The model also provides a breakdown of the risk scores by category. This allows users to identify the risk drivers and understand the relative contributions of different risk factor categories to the overall risk.

3. **Risk Status**: Based on the total risk score and a predefined risk threshold, the model classifies the risk status as either "High Risk" or "Low Risk". This categorization can help users quickly assess the overall risk profile and determine appropriate risk management actions.

To interpret the results of the risk calculation model, users should consider the following:

1. **Total Risk Score**: The total risk score provides an aggregate measure of the overall risk exposure. A higher score indicates a higher level of risk, while a lower score suggests a lower risk profile. Users should evaluate the total risk score in the context of their risk appetite and tolerance levels to determine if the risk is acceptable or requires further mitigation.

2. **Risk Breakdown by Category**: The breakdown of risk by category can help users identify the key risk drivers and focus their risk management efforts on the areas that contribute the most to the overall risk. Users should review the relative contributions of each risk factor category and prioritize their attention and resources accordingly.

3. **Risk Status**: The classification of the risk status as "High Risk" or "Low Risk" based on the total risk score and the predefined threshold can serve as a quick indicator of the overall risk profile. Users should interpret this status in the context of their specific risk management framework and decision-making processes. A "High Risk" status may trigger additional scrutiny, analysis, or risk mitigation actions, while a "Low Risk" status may indicate a more stable and manageable risk profile.

It is important to note that the interpretation of the model's results should be done in the context of the model's purpose, scope, and limitations, as outlined in the earlier sections of the documentation. Users should be aware of any known assumptions, exclusions, or potential biases inherent in the model, and consider these factors when drawing conclusions from the reported results.

Additionally, users should be mindful that the risk calculation model is a tool to support decision-making, but it should not be the sole basis for risk management decisions. The model's outputs should be combined with other relevant information, expert judgment, and a broader understanding of the organization's risk landscape to make informed and holistic risk management decisions.
