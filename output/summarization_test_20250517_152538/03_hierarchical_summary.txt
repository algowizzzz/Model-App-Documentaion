Based on the provided file summaries, the codebase appears to consist of the following main components and their relationships:

I. Web Application
   A. Frontend
      1. styles.css
         - Defines the visual styles and layout for the web application's HTML elements.
      2. app.js
         - A test or example JavaScript file, likely for demonstration or educational purposes.

   B. Backend
      1. Configuration
         - config.json
            - Provides centralized configuration settings and metadata for the project.

      2. Data Processing
         - data.xml
            - An XML data file containing structured information about a person and metadata.

      3. Risk Calculation System
         - complex_module.py
            - Implements the core risk calculation logic by combining multiple risk factors.
            - Consists of the RiskFactor and RiskCalculator classes, as well as the create_risk_report function.
            - Responsible for calculating total risk scores, generating risk breakdowns, and validating risk factor inputs.

      4. Database
         - query.sql
            - A test SQL script for creating a table and executing a sample query.

II. Documentation and Testing
    A. Documentation Templates
       1. templates/valid_template.json
          - Defines a valid JSON template for structuring documentation related to models or code components.
       2. templates/invalid_template.json
          - An invalid JSON template definition for documentation, containing syntax errors.

    B. Testing and Examples
       1. test_sample.py
          - A test or example Python file containing various code snippets and structures for demonstration and parsing purposes.
       2. invalid_syntax.py
          - A file containing syntactically incorrect Python code, likely for testing or demonstration purposes.

    C. Project Documentation
       - readme.md
          - A test markdown file, potentially for verifying the handling of non-parseable files.

III. Overall Architecture and Design Patterns
    - The codebase appears to follow a modular structure, with separate files and components responsible for different aspects of the application, such as frontend styling, backend logic, data processing, and risk calculation.
    - The risk calculation system (complex_module.py) seems to be a core component, implementing the main business logic for calculating and aggregating risk scores from multiple risk factors.
    - The use of configuration files (config.json) suggests a centralized approach to managing project settings and metadata.
    - The presence of documentation templates (templates/valid_template.json, templates/invalid_template.json) indicates a standardized approach to documenting models or code components.
    - The inclusion of test files (test_sample.py, invalid_syntax.py) and examples (app.js) suggests a focus on testing, demonstration, and educational purposes within the codebase.

Note: The provided file summaries do not explicitly mention any specific design patterns or architectural styles being followed. However, the modular structure and separation of concerns observed in the codebase align with common software engineering principles.
