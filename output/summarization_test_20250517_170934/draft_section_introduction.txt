1. Introduction

1.1. Purpose of the Model
The primary purpose of this model is to implement a comprehensive risk calculation system that can assess and quantify the risk exposure of a given portfolio or set of financial instruments. The model is designed to serve as a core component within a broader risk management framework, providing detailed risk assessments and reports to support various business objectives, such as regulatory capital calculation, risk-based decision-making, and portfolio optimization.

The key objectives of this model are to:
- Calculate the total risk score for a given set of risk factors, using a weighted aggregation approach.
- Provide a breakdown of the risk scores by category or risk type, enabling targeted risk mitigation strategies.
- Validate the input risk factors to ensure they meet the required criteria (e.g., valid weights and values).
- Generate a comprehensive risk report that summarizes the overall risk profile, including the total risk score, risk breakdown, and a status indicator (high-risk or low-risk) based on a predefined risk threshold.

1.2. Scope and Applicability
This risk calculation model is designed to handle a wide range of financial instruments and portfolios, including (but not limited to) derivatives, fixed-income securities, and equity positions. The model is capable of processing multiple risk factors, each with its own weight, value, and category, to produce a holistic risk assessment.

The model's scope includes the following key aspects:
- Supported asset classes: Derivatives, fixed-income, and equities
- Risk factor types: Market risk, credit risk, operational risk, and liquidity risk
- Portfolio coverage: Ability to assess risk at the individual instrument, counterparty, and overall portfolio levels
- Regulatory compliance: Alignment with relevant regulatory guidelines, such as those specified in OSFI E-23 and SR 11-7

The model does not currently cover certain specialized asset classes, such as alternative investments or structured products, nor does it handle complex interdependencies or nonlinear risk relationships. These limitations and exclusions will be further discussed in the "Limitations and Future Enhancements" section.

1.3. Intended Users
The primary users of this risk calculation model and its outputs are:
- Risk managers: Responsible for monitoring and managing the overall risk profile of the organization's portfolios and trading activities.
- Portfolio managers: Utilize the model's risk assessments to optimize portfolio composition, set risk limits, and make informed investment decisions.
- Regulatory reporting teams: Leverage the model's risk calculations and reports to fulfill regulatory capital and risk disclosure requirements.
- Senior management: Consume the model's risk insights to support strategic decision-making, risk appetite setting, and capital allocation.

1.4. Regulatory Context
This risk calculation model and its associated documentation adhere to the guidelines and requirements set forth in the following regulatory frameworks:
- OSFI E-23: "Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Management for Deposit-Taking Institutions"
- SR 11-7: "Guidance on Model Risk Management" issued by the Federal Reserve

The model's design, implementation, and documentation processes have been aligned with the key principles and expectations outlined in these regulatory guidelines, ensuring a robust and well-governed approach to model risk management.
