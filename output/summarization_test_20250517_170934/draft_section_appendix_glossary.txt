Appendix A: Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions of key technical terms, acronyms, and business-specific jargon used throughout the model documentation.

Algorithms: Detailed, step-by-step computational procedures for solving a problem or performing a task.

Architecture: The overall design and structure of a software system, including its components, their relationships, and the principles governing their design and evolution.

Business Logic: The specific rules, calculations, and decision-making processes that encode the core functionality of a business application.

Codebase: The complete collection of source code files, including all programming languages, that make up a software project or system.

Configuration: The set of parameters, settings, and dependencies that define the operating environment and behavior of a software application or system.

Data Structures: Organized collections of data elements, such as arrays, lists, trees, or graphs, that are designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate information.

Dependency: A relationship where one component or module relies on another component or module to function properly.

Error Handling: The mechanisms and processes used to detect, manage, and recover from errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a software system.

Hierarchical Model: A structured representation of a system or process, where higher-level components are broken down into more detailed, lower-level components.

Inputs: The data or parameters that are provided to a function, algorithm, or system as the starting point for its operations.

Logging: The process of recording events, messages, or diagnostic information during the execution of a software system, typically for the purposes of monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing.

Metadata: Data that provides information about other data, such as the creation date, author, or version of a document or file.

Outputs: The data or results that are produced by a function, algorithm, or system as the outcome of its operations.

Presentation Layer: The part of a software system responsible for the user interface and visual representation of information.

Regulatory Context: The set of laws, regulations, and industry standards that govern the development, deployment, and use of a software system, particularly in regulated industries.

Risk Factor: A variable or characteristic that contributes to the overall risk or uncertainty associated with a particular outcome or event.

Risk Report: A comprehensive summary of the risk assessment for a system or process, including the total risk score, breakdown by risk categories, and an overall risk status.

Subsections: Smaller, more focused sections within a larger section of a document or report.

Syntax: The rules and structure that define the proper composition of statements and expressions in a programming language.

Validation: The process of checking that a software system or its components meet the specified requirements, standards, and expectations for their intended functionality and performance.
