Based on the provided file summaries, the hierarchical summary of the codebase is as follows:

**High-Level Overview:**
The codebase appears to be a part of a larger system or application focused on financial risk management or portfolio analysis. It consists of three main components: a configuration file, a core risk calculation module, and a test or example file.

**Main Components:**

1. **Configuration Management**
   - **Purpose:** Provides centralized configuration settings and metadata for the project.
   - **File:** `config.json`
   - **Key Functionality:**
     - Stores project configuration data as key-value pairs in a JSON object.
     - Specifies dependencies on internal modules or packages ("module1" and "module2").

2. **Risk Calculation Module**
   - **Purpose:** Implements the core logic for calculating and aggregating risk scores based on multiple risk factors.
   - **File:** `complex_module.py`
   - **Key Components:**
     - **RiskFactor** (class): Represents an individual risk factor with its name, weight, value, and category.
     - **RiskCalculator** (class): Calculates the total risk score, generates risk breakdown by category, and validates risk factor inputs.
     - **create_risk_report** (function): Creates a comprehensive risk report dictionary containing total risk, risk breakdown, risk status, and timestamp.
   - **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
     - Weighted sum calculation for overall risk score and category-wise risk breakdown.
     - Input validation for risk factor weights and values.
   - **Dependencies:**
     - Internal: None.
     - External: `typing`, `dataclasses`, `datetime`.

3. **Test/Example Component**
   - **Purpose:** Serves as a test or example file, likely for testing, demonstration, or educational purposes.
   - **File:** `app.js`
   - **Key Components:**
     - **TestClass**: A simple class with a `doubleValue` method for testing and demonstration.
     - **testFunction**: A simple function that concatenates two input parameters.
   - **Dependencies:**
     - Internal: None.
     - External: None.

**Relationships and Architecture:**

1. The `config.json` file provides configuration settings and dependencies for the overall project, which may be consumed by various components, including the risk calculation module (`complex_module.py`).

2. The `complex_module.py` file contains the core logic for risk calculation and aggregation. It defines the `RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator` classes, as well as the `create_risk_report` function, which work together to calculate and generate comprehensive risk reports based on multiple risk factors.

3. The `app.js` file appears to be a separate test or example file, likely used for testing or demonstration purposes within the broader system or codebase. It does not seem to have a direct relationship with the other components based on the provided information.

**Design Patterns and Principles:**

1. **Separation of Concerns:** The codebase separates the configuration management, core risk calculation logic, and testing/example components into different files or modules, promoting modularity and maintainability.

2. **Data Encapsulation:** The `RiskFactor` class encapsulates the properties and behavior of an individual risk factor, promoting code organization and reusability.

3. **Dependency Injection:** The `config.json` file specifies dependencies on internal modules or packages, suggesting the use of dependency injection principles for managing dependencies.

4. **Validation and Error Handling:** The `RiskCalculator` class includes input validation mechanisms for risk factor weights and values, promoting robust and reliable risk calculations.

Overall, the codebase follows a modular design approach, separating concerns into different components and files. The risk calculation module appears to be the core component, responsible for implementing the main business logic and algorithms related to risk assessment and reporting.
