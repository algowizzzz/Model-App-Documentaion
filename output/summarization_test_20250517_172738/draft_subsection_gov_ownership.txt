The [business_unit] team works closely with other relevant stakeholders, such as the Risk Management, Finance, and Regulatory Compliance teams, to ensure the model aligns with BMO's overall risk management framework and regulatory requirements.

Any changes or updates to the model, including modifications to the underlying code, configuration, or methodologies, must be reviewed and approved by the model owner and the independent model validator before being implemented. The model is subject to periodic independent validation and ongoing monitoring to ensure its continued effectiveness and compliance with BMO's model governance standards.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the model ownership or governance, please contact the model owner, [model_owner_name], at [model_owner_contact_info].
