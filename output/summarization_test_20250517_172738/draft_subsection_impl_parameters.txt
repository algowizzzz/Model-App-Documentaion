4.3. Key Parameters and Calibration

This section identifies the key model parameters, distinguishes between calibrated parameters and fixed inputs, and describes the calibration methods used in the risk calculation model.

Key Model Parameters
The risk calculation model defined in the `complex_module.py` file has the following key parameters:

1. **Risk Factors**:
   - The `RiskFactor` class represents a single risk factor, with the following attributes:
     - `name`: The name of the risk factor.
     - `weight`: The weight or importance of the risk factor, which must be between 0 and 1.
     - `value`: The value or magnitude of the risk factor, which must be greater than or equal to 0.
     - `category`: The category or type of the risk factor (e.g., market risk, credit risk).
   - The `RiskCalculator` class takes a list of `RiskFactor` instances as input and is responsible for calculating the overall risk score.

2. **Risk Threshold**:
   - The `RiskCalculator` class also takes a `risk_threshold` parameter, which is used to determine whether the overall risk is considered "high-risk" or "low-risk".

Calibrated Parameters vs. Fixed Inputs
In the risk calculation model:

- The `RiskFactor` instances, including their weights and values, are considered calibrated parameters. These parameters are expected to be adjusted or recalibrated based on market conditions, historical data, or expert judgment.
- The `risk_threshold` parameter is a fixed input that represents the risk tolerance level set by the model owners or stakeholders. This threshold is not expected to change frequently and is considered a fixed input to the model.

Calibration Methods
The calibration of the `RiskFactor` instances is not explicitly described in the provided codebase summaries. However, the following general principles can be inferred:

1. **Data-Driven Calibration**:
   - The weights and values of the `RiskFactor` instances are likely calibrated based on historical data, market observations, or other quantitative sources.
   - This may involve statistical analysis, regression modeling, or other data-driven techniques to determine the appropriate parameter values.

2. **Expert Judgment**:
   - In addition to data-driven calibration, the model owners or subject matter experts may also provide input on the appropriate weights and values for the `RiskFactor` instances.
   - This expert judgment can be used to fine-tune the parameters or to incorporate qualitative considerations that may not be fully captured by the data.

The specific calibration methods and processes used for this model are not detailed in the provided codebase summaries. Further investigation or documentation from the model owners would be required to fully understand the calibration approach.

Configuration File Reference
The configuration settings for the test project, including any relevant parameters or settings related to the risk calculation model, are defined in the `config.json` file. This file specifies the project metadata, debug settings, and external dependencies, but does not contain any direct references to the key parameters or calibration methods used in the `complex_module.py` file.

[Information regarding the specific configuration settings or parameters related to the risk calculation model needs to be sourced/further investigated as it is not fully available in the provided codebase summaries.]
