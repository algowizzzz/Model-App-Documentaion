1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to represent and value an Equity Total Return Swap (TRS) financial instrument.
   - Its specific role is to provide a self-contained class for modeling and calculating the mark-to-market (MtM) and exposure values of an Equity TRS contract, which is likely a component of a larger risk management or pricing system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **Class: EquityTRS**
     - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the logic and calculations for an Equity Total Return Swap.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes the TRS contract with trade details (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Calculates the MtM values for a given set of underlying price paths.
       - Calculates the exposure values from the MtM values.
     - **Inputs:**
       - Trade details dictionary (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Array of current underlying price paths (time steps, num paths).
     - **Outputs:**
       - MtM values array (time steps, num paths).
       - Exposure values array (time steps, num paths).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The MtM calculation is based on the change in the underlying equity price relative to the initial price at inception, multiplied by the notional amount. The calculation is adjusted for the trade type (receiver or payer).
   - The exposure calculation simply takes the maximum of 0 and the MtM values, assuming positive MtM means the counterparty owes the TRS holder.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure is a NumPy array representing the underlying price paths, with shape (num_time_steps + 1, num_paths).
   - The trade details are stored in a Python dictionary.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy library for numerical operations and array manipulation.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `__init__` method raises a `ValueError` if the `trade_type` is invalid.
   - The file uses `print` statements to log the creation of the TRS instrument and the MtM calculation process, which could be replaced with a proper logging library in a production environment.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that the funding leg (fixed or floating rate payments) of the TRS is netted against the equity leg at each valuation date, focusing solely on the change in equity value.
   - The exposure calculation assumes that positive MtM values indicate the counterparty owes the TRS holder, which may not hold true in all cases or under different assumptions.
   - The file does not handle any potential exceptions or edge cases beyond the `trade_type` validation, such as handling zero or negative initial prices.
