**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
This file contains an implementation of the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices over time. Its primary purpose is to provide a reusable component for generating multiple paths of asset price trajectories based on the GBM stochastic process. This file is likely a part of a larger financial modeling or risk management system, serving as a simulation engine component for asset price evolution under the GBM assumption.

**2. Key Components and Functionality:**
- **Class: GBMProcess**
    - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the GBM process for simulating asset prices.
    - **Key Operations:**
        - Initializes the GBM process with given parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta).
        - Generates multiple asset price paths over specified time steps using the GBM equation.
    - **Inputs:**
        - Initial asset price (S0), drift rate (mu), volatility (sigma), and time delta (dt).
        - Number of time steps and number of paths to generate.
    - **Outputs:**
        - A NumPy array containing the simulated asset prices for each path and time step.

**3. Core Algorithms and Logic:**
The core algorithm implemented in this file is the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process, which is a widely used stochastic process for modeling asset prices in finance. The GBM equation is used to simulate the evolution of asset prices over time, incorporating the effects of drift (expected return) and volatility (randomness). The file generates multiple paths by iteratively applying the GBM equation with random shocks drawn from a standard normal distribution.

**4. Data Structures:**
The primary data structure used is a NumPy array to store and return the simulated asset price paths. The array has a shape of (num_steps + 1, num_paths), where each column represents a distinct price path, and each row represents a time step (including the initial price at t=0).

**5. Dependencies:**
- **Internal:** None (assuming this is a standalone file).
- **External:**
    - NumPy: Used for efficient numerical operations and random number generation.

**6. Error Handling and Logging:**
- Error Handling: The `generate_paths` method includes a check for invalid inputs (non-positive number of steps or paths), raising a `ValueError` in such cases.
- Logging: The file uses `print` statements to log the initialization parameters and the number of paths/steps generated. However, it does not employ a dedicated logging library.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
- Assumptions:
    - The asset prices follow a Geometric Brownian Motion process.
    - The drift rate, volatility, and time delta are constant over the simulation period.
- Limitations:
    - The GBM process assumes continuous-time trading and log-normal price distributions, which may not accurately reflect real-world market dynamics.
    - The file does not include functionality for incorporating additional factors (e.g., jumps, stochastic volatility) or advanced features like path-dependent options.
