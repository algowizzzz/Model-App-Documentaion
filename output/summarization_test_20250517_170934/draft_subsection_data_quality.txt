3.3. Data Quality Assessment

This section outlines the processes for assessing the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of the data used by the model. It details how missing, erroneous, or anomalous data are identified and handled.

Data Quality Assurance Processes
--------------------------------

The model relies on several key data sources, including the `data.xml` file, which contains structured information about persons, and various configuration parameters defined in the `config.json` file. To ensure the integrity and suitability of these data inputs, the following data quality assurance processes are implemented:

1. **Data Validation**:
   - The `RiskCalculator` class in the `complex_module.py` file includes a `_validate_factors` method that checks the risk factors for invalid weights and values. This ensures that the input data meets the expected criteria before being used in the risk calculations.
   - The `config.json` file is reviewed to verify that the configuration parameters, such as the `debug` flag, `maxRetries`, and `timeout`, are within reasonable and expected ranges.

2. **Data Completeness Checks**:
   - The model requires a non-empty list of risk factors to be provided to the `RiskCalculator` class. If an empty list is passed, the class will raise an error, indicating that the data is incomplete.
   - The `data.xml` file is checked to ensure that each `person` element contains the required `name`, `age`, and `skills` sub-elements. If any of these are missing, the data is considered incomplete and may be flagged for further investigation.

3. **Data Anomaly Detection**:
   - The `RiskCalculator` class monitors the risk factor values and weights to identify any outliers or anomalies that may indicate data quality issues. For example, if a risk factor has a weight outside the expected range of 0 to 1, or a value that is significantly higher or lower than the typical range, the class will log a warning.
   - The model also checks the `created_at` timestamp in the `query.sql` file to ensure that only users created within the last 7 days are included in the results. This helps identify and exclude any potentially outdated or irrelevant data.

Handling of Missing, Erroneous, or Anomalous Data
-------------------------------------------------

When the data quality assurance processes identify missing, erroneous, or anomalous data, the following handling procedures are in place:

1. **Missing Data**:
   - If the `RiskCalculator` class is provided with an empty list of risk factors, it will raise a `ValueError` exception, indicating that the data is incomplete.
   - For the `data.xml` file, if any required `person` sub-elements are missing, the model will log a warning and exclude the affected person data from further processing.

2. **Erroneous Data**:
   - In the `RiskCalculator` class, if any risk factors have invalid weights or values, the `_validate_factors` method will return a list of validation error messages. These errors will be logged, and the affected risk factors will be excluded from the risk calculations.
   - For the configuration parameters in the `config.json` file, if any values are outside the expected ranges, the model will log a warning and use default or fallback values instead.

3. **Anomalous Data**:
   - The `RiskCalculator` class monitors the risk factor values and weights for any outliers or anomalies. If detected, the class will log a warning message, but the affected data will still be included in the risk calculations, as the model is designed to be resilient to minor data quality issues.
   - The `query.sql` file's user data filtering based on the `created_at` timestamp helps identify and exclude any potentially outdated or irrelevant data from the results.

In all cases, the model's logging and error handling mechanisms ensure that any data quality issues are properly documented and can be investigated further if necessary. The model is designed to be as robust as possible to minor data quality problems, but significant issues may require manual intervention or data cleansing before the model can be reliably used.
