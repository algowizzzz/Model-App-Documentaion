**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
The primary purpose of this file is to implement a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices over time. It serves as a component within a broader financial modeling or simulation system, providing a method to generate multiple paths of asset price evolution based on the GBM stochastic process.

**2. Key Components and Functionality:**
- **Class: GBMProcess**
    - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the GBM process for simulating asset prices.
    - **Key Operations:**
        - Initializes the process with initial price, drift, volatility, and time delta parameters.
        - Generates multiple asset price paths using the GBM process.
    - **Inputs:**
        - Initial price (float): The starting price of the asset.
        - Drift (float): The expected rate of return (e.g., risk-free rate - dividend yield).
        - Volatility (float): The volatility of the asset price.
        - Time delta (float): The time increment for each step (in years).
        - Number of steps (int): The number of time steps to simulate for each path.
        - Number of paths (int): The number of distinct paths to generate.
    - **Outputs:**
        - numpy.ndarray: An array of shape (num_steps + 1, num_paths) containing the simulated asset prices, including the initial price at t=0.

**3. Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
The core algorithm implemented in this file is the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices. The `generate_paths` method iteratively calculates the next asset price based on the previous price, drift, volatility, and a random shock drawn from a standard normal distribution. The drift and volatility terms are pre-calculated for efficiency.

**4. Data Structures:**
The primary data structure used is a NumPy array to store and return the simulated asset price paths. The array has a shape of (num_steps + 1, num_paths), where each column represents a distinct price path, and each row represents a time step.

**5. Dependencies:**
- **Internal:** None (assuming this is a standalone file).
- **External:**
    - NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, used for efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.

**6. Error Handling and Logging:**
- Error Handling: The `generate_paths` method checks if the provided `num_steps` and `num_paths` are positive integers, raising a `ValueError` if they are not.
- Logging: The file uses `print` statements to log the initialization of the `GBMProcess` instance and the successful generation of price paths.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
- Assumptions:
    - The input parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta) are valid and within reasonable ranges for the GBM process.
    - The time delta is specified in years, and the drift and volatility parameters are annualized.
- Limitations:
    - The GBM process assumes constant drift and volatility over time, which may not accurately reflect real-world asset price dynamics.
    - The implementation does not account for potential adjustments or modifications to the GBM process, such as incorporating jumps or stochastic volatility.
    - The file does not include any functionality for visualizing or analyzing the generated price paths.
