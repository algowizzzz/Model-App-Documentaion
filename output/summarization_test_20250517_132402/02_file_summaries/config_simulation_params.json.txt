**SUMMARY:**

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - This file serves as a configuration file for setting up simulation parameters.
   - Its role is to provide input parameters for a simulation engine or model, likely related to Potential Future Exposure (PFE) calculations.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - The file does not contain any classes, functions, or methods. It is a JSON configuration file with key-value pairs.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - No algorithms or complex logic are implemented within this file. It merely stores configuration parameters.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file uses a JSON object as its data structure, containing the following key-value pairs:
     - `"simulation_id"`: A string identifier for the simulation run.
     - `"num_paths"`: An integer specifying the number of simulation paths.
     - `"pfe_quantile"`: A float representing the quantile level for PFE calculations (e.g., 0.95 for 95th percentile).
     - `"output_directory"`: A string specifying the directory path for storing simulation results.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** None. This file does not import or utilize any external libraries or packages.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - No explicit error handling or logging mechanisms are present in this file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - **Assumptions:**
     - The values provided for the configuration parameters are valid and within expected ranges.
     - The specified `output_directory` exists or can be created.
   - **Limitations:**
     - The configuration parameters are hard-coded in this file, which may limit flexibility and require code changes for different simulation setups.
     - No validation or error handling is implemented for the provided parameter values.
