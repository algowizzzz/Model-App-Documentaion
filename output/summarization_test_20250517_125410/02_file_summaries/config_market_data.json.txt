The `config/market_data.json` file is a configuration file that stores market data for two equity instruments, `EQ_A` and `EQ_B`. The main purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for storing and managing the market data required for financial calculations or simulations involving these equity instruments.

The file is structured as a JSON object, where each key (`EQ_A` and `EQ_B`) represents an equity instrument. The value associated with each key is another JSON object containing the following properties:

1. `current_price`: The current market price of the equity instrument.
2. `volatility`: The volatility of the equity instrument, which is a measure of its price fluctuations over time.
3. `risk_free_rate`: The risk-free rate of return, typically based on government bond yields.
4. `dividend_yield`: The dividend yield of the equity instrument, which represents the annual dividend payments as a percentage of the current price.

This file does not contain any functions, classes, or methods. It is a simple data structure that stores market data in a structured format (JSON) for easy access and manipulation by other parts of the application or financial models.

The relationships or dependencies in this file are implicit. Any part of the application or financial model that requires market data for the equity instruments `EQ_A` and `EQ_B` will likely depend on or reference this file to retrieve the necessary information.

There are no notable algorithms or patterns used in this file. It is a straightforward data storage file in a widely-used format (JSON) for representing structured data.
