4. Model Implementation

4.1. System Architecture

The model implementation is structured around a core set of modules and components that work together to provide the overall functionality. At a high level, the system architecture consists of the following key elements:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer includes the CSS stylesheets (`styles.css`) that define the visual styles and layout of the web application's user interface.
- **Data and Configuration Management**: This layer handles the storage and retrieval of configuration settings (`config.json`) and structured data (`data.xml`) required by the model.
- **Modeling and Calculation**: The central component of the system is the `complex_module.py` file, which implements the core risk calculation logic. This module defines the `RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator` classes, as well as the `create_risk_report` function, to handle the assessment and aggregation of risk scores.
- **Testing and Validation**: The codebase includes several files dedicated to testing and validation, such as `test_sample.py`, `invalid_syntax.py`, and JSON template files (`invalid_template.json`, `valid_template.json`) that define the expected structure and requirements for model configurations and documentation.
- **Miscellaneous**: The codebase also contains a few additional files, including a test JavaScript file (`app.js`), a SQL query (`query.sql`), and a test markdown file (`readme.md`), which serve as examples or test cases for handling non-Python file types.

The overall architecture suggests a web application or system that requires robust modeling, testing, and documentation capabilities to support its core functionality, which appears to be focused on risk assessment and reporting.

4.2. Detailed Module Descriptions

4.2.1. `styles.css`
- **Purpose**: Defines the visual styles and layout for the web application's user interface, including the main container and header elements.
- **Key Components**: The `.container` class sets the display and direction of the main content container, while the `.header` class styles the application's header or title.
- **Dependencies**: This CSS file does not have any direct dependencies on other modules or external libraries.

4.2.2. `test_sample.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides a set of Python structures and functions for testing and demonstration purposes, including a simple function, a test class with a nested function, and a global constant.
- **Key Components**: The `simple_function` returns a greeting string, the `TestClass` demonstrates the use of a class with methods and a nested function, and the `GLOBAL_CONSTANT` is a global string variable.
- **Dependencies**: The file imports the `typing` module for type annotations.

4.2.3. `config.json`
- **Purpose**: Stores configuration settings and metadata for the test project, including debug mode, maximum retries, timeout, and external dependencies.
- **Key Components**: The file defines the project name, version, description, and various configuration parameters and dependencies.
- **Dependencies**: This file does not have any direct internal dependencies, but it specifies two external dependencies: `module1` and `module2`.

4.2.4. `query.sql`
- **Purpose**: Defines a SQL query that retrieves user data from a database table, including a `CREATE TABLE` statement and a `SELECT` query with filtering and sorting.
- **Key Components**: The query creates a `users` table with `id`, `name`, `email`, and `created_at` columns, and then selects the `name` and `email` columns for users created within the last 7 days, ordered by the `created_at` column in descending order.
- **Dependencies**: This file does not have any internal dependencies, as it is a standalone SQL query. It relies on the underlying database management system to execute the query and retrieve the requested data.

4.2.5. `readme.md`
- **Purpose**: Serves as a test markdown file to verify how the loader handles non-parseable files.
- **Key Components**: The file contains a single function, `example()`, which does not perform any significant operations.
- **Dependencies**: This file does not have any internal or external dependencies.

4.2.6. `complex_module.py`
- **Purpose**: Implements a risk calculation system with multiple components and nested structures, including the `RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator` classes, as well as the `create_risk_report` function.
- **Key Components**:
