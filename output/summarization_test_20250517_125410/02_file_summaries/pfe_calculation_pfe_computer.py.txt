The main purpose of this file is to provide a class `PFEQuantileCalculator` that calculates the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profile at a given quantile from a set of exposure paths. The PFE profile represents the quantile of positive exposures across all paths at each time step.

The key components are:

1. `PFEQuantileCalculator` class:
   - Initializes with a quantile value between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.95 for 95th percentile).
   - `calculate_pfe_profile` method: Calculates the PFE profile from exposure paths. It takes a 2D numpy array of exposure values (time steps x paths) and returns a 1D array of PFE values over time.

The `calculate_pfe_profile` method uses the `numpy.percentile` function to calculate the specified quantile of positive exposures across paths for each time step. It ensures that the resulting PFE values are non-negative.

The file has no external dependencies other than the NumPy library for array operations.

The main algorithm used is the calculation of quantiles across exposure paths for each time step. This is achieved by leveraging NumPy's `percentile` function, which efficiently computes quantiles along a specified axis of a multi-dimensional array.

The file also includes a `main` section that demonstrates the usage of the `PFEQuantileCalculator` class with example exposure paths and different quantile values (95th and 50th percentiles).

Overall, this file provides a concise and efficient implementation for calculating the PFE profile, which is a common risk metric in financial risk management.
