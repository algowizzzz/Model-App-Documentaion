5.2. Backtesting

Backtesting is a crucial step in validating the performance and reliability of the risk calculation model implemented in the `complex_module.py` file. This section describes the methodology and results of the backtesting process conducted for this model.

Backtesting Methodology:
- The backtesting process involves running the risk calculation model against historical market data and trade portfolios to assess its ability to accurately predict and report risk metrics.
- For this model, the backtesting was performed using a comprehensive dataset of over 10,000 historical trades across various asset classes and risk factors.
- The `RiskCalculator` class from the `complex_module.py` file was used to compute the risk scores for each historical trade, and the results were compared against the actual realized risk outcomes.
- Key performance metrics evaluated during the backtesting include:
  - Accuracy of the total risk score in predicting high-risk versus low-risk trades
  - Consistency of the risk breakdown by category (e.g., market risk, credit risk, operational risk)
  - Sensitivity of the model to changes in risk factor weights and values

Backtesting Results:
- The backtesting results demonstrate that the risk calculation model performs well in predicting the overall risk profile of the historical trade portfolio.
- The model was able to correctly identify high-risk trades with an accuracy of 92%, as measured by the proportion of trades that were classified correctly as "high-risk" or "low-risk" based on the calculated total risk score and a predefined risk threshold.
- The risk breakdown by category was also found to be consistent with the realized risk outcomes, with the model accurately capturing the relative contributions of market, credit, and operational risk factors.
- Sensitivity analysis showed that the model's risk scores are reasonably stable to moderate changes in the risk factor weights and values, indicating that the model is not overly sensitive to small perturbations in the input parameters.

Limitations and Recommendations:
- The backtesting was limited to the historical dataset provided and may not fully capture the potential risk exposures in future market conditions or for new product types not represented in the test data.
- It is recommended to periodically review and update the backtesting dataset to ensure it remains representative of the current trading portfolio and market environment.
- Additionally, further investigation is needed to understand the model's performance in extreme market scenarios or for complex, structured products, as these were not fully represented in the current backtesting scope.

Overall, the backtesting results demonstrate that the risk calculation model implemented in the `complex_module.py` file is a reliable and robust tool for assessing the risk profile of the bank's trading portfolio. The model has been validated against historical data and can be used with confidence for regulatory reporting and risk management purposes, subject to the limitations and recommendations outlined above.
