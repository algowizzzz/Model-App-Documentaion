SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file, `simulation_params.json`, is to define the configuration parameters for a simulation run.
   - This file is a critical component of the broader model or system, as it provides the necessary input parameters to drive the simulation engine and generate the desired performance metrics.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - This file contains a single JSON object with the following key-value pairs:
     - `"simulation_id"`: A unique identifier for the simulation run.
     - `"num_paths"`: The number of simulation paths to be generated.
     - `"pfe_quantile"`: The quantile value to be used for the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) calculation.
     - `"output_directory"`: The directory where the simulation results will be stored.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - This file does not contain any core algorithms or significant business logic. It simply defines the configuration parameters for the simulation run.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file contains a single JSON object, which is a standard data structure for representing structured data in a text-based format.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** This file does not have any direct dependencies on other modules, classes, or functions within the codebase. It is a standalone configuration file.
   - **External:** This file does not have any external library or package dependencies. It is a self-contained configuration file.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - This file does not contain any explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities. It is a static configuration file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that the values provided for the configuration parameters are valid and within the expected ranges for the simulation engine.
   - The file does not have any inherent limitations, as it is a simple configuration file. The limitations would be determined by the broader model or system that consumes this configuration.
