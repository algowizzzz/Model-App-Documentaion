The provided file `complex_module.py` is a Python module that implements a risk calculation system. Its main purpose is to calculate and aggregate risk scores based on multiple risk factors, providing both detailed and summary risk assessments.

The key components of this module are:

1. `RiskFactor` class: Represents an individual risk factor with attributes like name, weight, value, and category. It provides a `calculate_impact` method to compute the weighted impact of the risk factor.

2. `RiskCalculator` class: The main class responsible for calculating and aggregating risk scores. It has methods like `calculate_total_risk` (calculates the overall risk score as a weighted sum of all factors), `get_risk_breakdown` (provides a breakdown of risk scores by category), and an internal `_validate_factors` method for validating risk factor inputs.

3. `create_risk_report` function: Generates a comprehensive risk report dictionary containing the total risk score, risk breakdown by category, risk status (high or low based on a threshold), and a timestamp.

The key relationships and dependencies in this module are:

- The `RiskCalculator` class depends on a list of `RiskFactor` instances, which are used to calculate the total risk score and risk breakdown.
- The `create_risk_report` function takes a `RiskCalculator` instance and uses its methods to generate the risk report dictionary.

Notable algorithms or patterns used:

- The `calculate_total_risk` method in the `RiskCalculator` class calculates the total risk score as a weighted sum of all risk factors, normalized to a 0-1 scale.
- The `get_risk_breakdown` method uses a dictionary to aggregate risk scores by category, iterating over the risk factors and updating the corresponding category scores.
- The `create_risk_report` function utilizes the `datetime` module to include a timestamp in the risk report.

Overall, this module provides a structured and modular approach to risk calculation and reporting, with clear separation of concerns between different components and the ability to handle multiple risk factors and categories.
