File: simulation_engine/gbm_model.py

**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
This file contains an implementation of the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices over time. Its primary purpose is to provide a reusable component for generating multiple paths of asset price trajectories, which can be utilized in various financial modeling and simulation tasks, such as option pricing, portfolio analysis, or risk management.

**2. Key Components and Functionality:**
- **Class: GBMProcess**
    - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the GBM process for simulating asset prices.
    - **Key Operations:**
        - Initializes the process with given parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta).
        - Generates multiple asset price paths over a specified number of time steps.
    - **Inputs:**
        - Initial price (float): The starting price of the asset.
        - Drift (float): The expected rate of return (e.g., risk-free rate - dividend yield).
        - Volatility (float): The volatility of the asset price.
        - Time delta (float): The time increment for each step (in years).
        - Number of steps (int): The number of time steps to simulate for each path.
        - Number of paths (int): The number of distinct paths to generate.
    - **Outputs:**
        - numpy.ndarray: An array of shape (num_steps + 1, num_paths) containing the simulated asset prices, including the initial price at t=0.

**3. Core Algorithms and Logic:**
The core algorithm implemented in this file is the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process, which is a widely used stochastic process for modeling asset prices in finance. The GBM process is defined by the following equation:

```
S(t+dt) = S(t) * exp((mu - 0.5 * sigma^2) * dt + sigma * sqrt(dt) * Z)
```

Where:
- `S(t)` is the asset price at time `t`
- `mu` is the drift term (expected rate of return)
- `sigma` is the volatility of the asset price
- `dt` is the time increment
- `Z` is a standard normal random variable

The `generate_paths` method implements this equation to simulate multiple asset price paths over a specified number of time steps. It generates random shocks from a standard normal distribution and iteratively calculates the next asset price based on the previous price, drift, volatility, and random shock.

**4. Data Structures:**
The primary data structure used in this file is a NumPy array to store and manipulate the simulated asset price paths. The `generate_paths` method returns a NumPy array of shape `(num_steps + 1, num_paths)`, where each column represents a distinct asset price path over time.

**5. Dependencies:**
- **Internal:** None (this file appears to be self-contained).
- **External:**
    - NumPy: A fundamental Python library for scientific computing, used for efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.

**6. Error Handling and Logging:**
- Error Handling: The `generate_paths` method includes a check for invalid input values (non-positive `num_steps` or `num_paths`), raising a `ValueError` exception in such cases.
- Logging: The file uses `print` statements to log the initialization parameters and the number of paths generated. However, it does not employ a dedicated logging library or framework.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**

    - The asset prices follow a Geometric Brownian Motion process, which assumes log-normal price distributions and constant drift and volatility over time.
    - The input parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta) are valid and within reasonable ranges.
- Limitations:
    - The GBM process is a simplified model and may not accurately capture real-world asset price dynamics, which can exhibit more complex behaviors, such as jumps, stochastic volatility, or regime shifts.
    - The implementation does not include any advanced features, such as parallelization or optimizations for large-scale simulations.
    - The file does not provide functionality for analyzing or visualizing the generated asset price paths.

File: financial_instruments/equity_trs.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to represent and value an Equity Total Return Swap (TRS) financial instrument.
   - Its specific role is to provide a self-contained class for modeling and calculating the mark-to-market (MtM) and exposure values of an Equity TRS contract, which is likely a component of a larger risk management or pricing system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **Class: EquityTRS**
     - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the representation and valuation of an Equity Total Return Swap.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes the TRS contract with trade details (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Calculates the MtM values of the TRS given current underlying price paths.
       - Calculates the exposure values from the MtM values.
     - **Inputs:**
       - Trade details dictionary (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Current underlying price paths as a NumPy array.
     - **Outputs:**
       - MtM values as a NumPy array.
       - Exposure values as a NumPy array.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The MtM calculation is based on the change in the underlying equity price relative to the initial price at inception, multiplied by the notional amount. This calculation is performed for each path and time step.
   - The exposure calculation simply takes the maximum of 0 and the MtM values, assuming positive MtM means the counterparty owes the TRS holder.
   - The trade type ('receive_equity_return' or 'pay_equity_return') determines the sign of the MtM values.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure is a NumPy array representing the current underlying price paths, with shape (num_time_steps + 1, num_paths).
   - The trade details are stored in a dictionary with keys 'notional', 'initial_price_at_inception', and 'trade_type'.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy library for numerical operations and array manipulation.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - A ValueError is raised if the 'trade_type' in the trade details is invalid (not 'receive_equity_return' or 'pay_equity_return').
   - Print statements are used for logging the creation of the EquityTRS instance and the MtM calculation results.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that the funding leg (fixed or floating rate payments) of the TRS is netted against the equity leg at each valuation date, focusing solely on the change in equity value.
   - The MtM calculation assumes that the initial price at inception is provided and does not account for potential adjustments or fees.
   - The exposure calculation assumes that positive MtM values represent exposure to the counterparty, which may not hold true in certain scenarios or under different assumptions.
   - The file does not handle other aspects of TRS valuation or risk management, such as collateral management, credit risk, or regulatory considerations.

File: pfe_calculation/pfe_computer.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to provide a class for calculating the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) at a given quantile from a set of exposure paths.
   - This file appears to be a standalone component responsible for a specific calculation step within a broader risk management or counterparty credit risk modeling system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **PFEQuantileCalculator** (Class)
     - **Purpose:** Calculate the PFE profile (a vector of PFE values over time) at a specified quantile from exposure paths.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes with a quantile value between 0 and 1.
       - Calculates the PFE at each time step as the specified quantile of positive exposures across paths.
       - Ensures PFE values are non-negative.
     - **Inputs:** A 2D NumPy array representing exposure paths (time_steps + 1, num_paths).
     - **Outputs:** A 1D NumPy array representing the PFE profile over time (num_time_steps + 1,).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The core algorithm used is the calculation of the quantile of positive exposures across paths at each time step using NumPy's `np.percentile` function.
   - The PFE profile is calculated by applying the specified quantile (e.g., 95th percentile) to the positive exposures at each time step.
   - A simple check is performed to ensure PFE values are non-negative.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure used is a 2D NumPy array representing exposure paths, with rows representing time steps and columns representing individual paths.
   - The output is a 1D NumPy array representing the PFE profile over time.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy (for array operations and quantile calculation).

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Basic error handling is implemented through a `ValueError` exception raised if the input `exposure_paths` array is not 2D.
   - The `__init__` method also raises a `ValueError` if the provided `quantile` is not between 0 and 1 (exclusive).
   - Logging is limited to printing statements for initialization and successful PFE profile calculation.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The code assumes that the input `exposure_paths` array has a specific shape, with the first row representing exposures at time t=0 (usually 0).
   - The calculation assumes that exposures are non-negative values, as it takes the quantile of positive exposures.
   - The PFE calculation is based solely on the specified quantile and does not consider any other risk factors or modeling assumptions.

File: pfe_calculation/exposure_aggregator.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to provide a class for aggregating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades.
   - Within the broader model or system, this file likely plays a role in calculating and reporting portfolio-level risk metrics, specifically related to counterparty credit risk and exposure management.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **TradeAggregator** (class)
     - **Purpose:** Manages the aggregation of PFE profiles across multiple trades.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Stores individual trade PFE profiles in a dictionary.
       - Provides a method to retrieve all stored individual PFE profiles.
       - Implements a simple summation method to aggregate PFE profiles across trades.
     - **Inputs:** Trade ID (string) and corresponding PFE profile (NumPy array).
     - **Outputs:** Dictionary of individual trade PFE profiles, aggregated PFE profile (NumPy array).

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method implements a basic aggregation approach by summing the PFE profiles of all trades at each time step. However, the code acknowledges that this is generally not the correct way to calculate portfolio PFE due to netting effects.
   - The method performs a check to ensure that all PFE profiles have the same length before summing them.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The `TradeAggregator` class uses a dictionary (`self.all_trade_pfe_profiles`) to store individual trade PFE profiles, with trade IDs as keys and NumPy arrays as values.
   - NumPy arrays are used to represent PFE profiles.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy (for array operations and numerical calculations).

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `add_trade_pfe_profile` method prints a warning if a PFE profile for a trade ID is being overwritten.
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method raises a `ValueError` if the PFE profiles have different lengths.
   - The file uses `print` statements for logging various events and messages.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that PFE profiles are represented as NumPy arrays of equal length across all trades.
   - The simple summation approach implemented in `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` is acknowledged as a limitation, as it does not account for netting effects in calculating portfolio PFE.
   - The file does not implement more complex aggregation methods, such as netting or considering trade dependencies, which are typically required for accurate portfolio PFE calculation.
