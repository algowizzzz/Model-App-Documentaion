     - **Outputs:** A new table in the database.
   - `SELECT` query:
     - **Purpose:** Retrieve user names and emails from the "users" table.
     - **Key Operations:** Filter records based on creation date, order results by creation timestamp.
     - **Inputs:** "users" table data.
     - **Outputs:** Filtered and ordered result set containing user names and emails.
