The provided file is a README.md that describes a Python project for calculating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) for a portfolio of Equity Total Return Swaps (TRS) using Monte Carlo simulation. The main purpose of the project is to estimate the potential future credit exposure arising from these derivative trades by simulating the underlying equity prices and valuing the trades across multiple scenarios.

The project is structured into several modules:

1. `data_management/`: Handles loading and managing input data such as trade details, market data, and simulation parameters from JSON files.
2. `financial_instruments/`: Defines and values financial instruments like Equity TRS.
3. `simulation_engine/`: Implements the Monte Carlo simulation and the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model for simulating underlying equity price paths.
4. `pfe_calculation/`: Calculates exposures and aggregates PFE profiles for individual trades and the portfolio.
5. `reporting/`: Writes the output PFE results to files.

The main workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Load input data from JSON files.
2. Simulate multiple price paths for each underlying asset using the GBM model.
3. Value the Equity TRS trades for each simulated price path and time step.
4. Calculate exposures as the positive mark-to-market values for each trade and path.
5. Compute the PFE profile for each trade by taking a percentile of the exposures across all paths.
6. Optionally, aggregate the PFE profiles across all trades.
7. Write the individual and aggregated PFE profiles to output files.

The project utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation technique and the Geometric Brownian Motion model, which is a widely used stochastic process for modeling asset prices in finance. The PFE calculation involves computing exposures, taking percentiles, and potentially aggregating across trades, which are common approaches in counterparty credit risk management.
