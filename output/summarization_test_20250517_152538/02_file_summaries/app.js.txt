**SUMMARY:**

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - This file serves as a test or example JavaScript file to verify the handling of non-Python files within the broader system or codebase.
   - Its primary role is likely for testing, demonstration, or educational purposes rather than being a core component of a production model or application.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **TestClass**
     - **Purpose:** A simple class for testing and demonstration purposes.
     - **Key Operations:** Initializes an instance with a value property.
     - **Inputs:** A value parameter for the constructor.
     - **Outputs:** An instance of the TestClass with the provided value.
     - **doubleValue(x)**
       - **Purpose:** A method to double a given number.
       - **Key Operations:** Multiplies the input number by 2.
       - **Inputs:** A number `x`.
       - **Outputs:** The doubled value of `x`.
   - **testFunction(param1, param2 = "default")**
     - **Purpose:** A simple function for testing and demonstration purposes.
     - **Key Operations:** Concatenates two strings.
     - **Inputs:** `param1` (required) and `param2` (optional, with a default value of "default").
     - **Outputs:** A string formed by concatenating `param1` and `param2` with a hyphen in between.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - This file does not appear to implement any complex algorithms or significant business logic specific to its responsibilities. It serves as a simple test or example file.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - No significant internal data structures are used or manipulated within this file.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None observed.
   - **External:** None observed.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - No explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities are implemented within this file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - **Assumptions:**
     - The `doubleValue` method assumes that the input `x` is a valid number.
     - The `testFunction` assumes that `param1` is a valid string or can be coerced to a string.
   - **Limitations:**
     - This file does not appear to have any significant limitations specific to its responsibilities as a test or example file.
