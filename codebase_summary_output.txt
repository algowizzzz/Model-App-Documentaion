File: styles.css
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:

The provided file `styles.css` is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file used for styling web pages. Its main purpose is to define the visual appearance and layout of HTML elements on a web page.

Key Components:

1. `.container` class:
   - Applies styles to elements with the class name "container".
   - Sets the `display` property to `flex`, creating a flex container.
   - Sets the `flex-direction` to `column`, arranging child elements vertically.
   - Adds `padding` of 20 pixels around the container.

2. `.header` class:
   - Applies styles to elements with the class name "header".
   - Sets the `font-size` to 24 pixels, making the text larger.
   - Sets the `color` to a dark gray shade (`#333`).
   - Adds a `margin-bottom` of 10 pixels, creating space below the header.

3. Media Query:
   - The `@media` rule is used to apply styles based on specific conditions, in this case, the maximum width of the viewport.
   - When the viewport width is 768 pixels or less (e.g., on smaller screens or mobile devices), the styles within the media query are applied.
   - Inside the media query, the `.container` class has its `padding` reduced to 10 pixels, adjusting the layout for smaller screens.

Important Relationships and Dependencies:

- The styles defined in this CSS file are intended to be applied to HTML elements on a web page.
- The `.container` and `.header` classes are likely used in conjunction with HTML elements that have those class names assigned.
- The media query styles are dependent on the viewport size, allowing for responsive design and adapting the layout to different screen sizes.

Notable Patterns:

- The use of CSS classes (`.container` and `.header`) follows the principle of modular and reusable styles, allowing for easy maintenance and application across multiple HTML elements.
- The flex layout (`display: flex`) is a modern CSS technique for creating flexible and responsive layouts, enabling easy alignment and distribution of child elements within a container.
- The media query implementation demonstrates the concept of responsive web design, where styles are adjusted based on the device's screen size or viewport dimensions, providing an optimized user experience across different devices.

Overall, this CSS file provides basic styling for a web page layout, including a header and a container with responsive behavior for smaller screens. It demonstrates the use of CSS classes, flex layout, and media queries, which are common patterns in modern web development.
