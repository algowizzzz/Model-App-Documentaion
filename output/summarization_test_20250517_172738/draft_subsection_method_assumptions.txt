2.3. Assumptions and Justifications

This section outlines the key assumptions made in the design and implementation of the risk calculation model, as well as the justifications for these assumptions. Understanding the underlying assumptions is critical for assessing the model's applicability, limitations, and potential areas of improvement.

Assumptions Related to Risk Factors:
- The `RiskFactor` class assumes that the weight of each risk factor is a valid value between 0 and 1, and the value of each risk factor is greater than or equal to 0. These assumptions ensure that the risk factors can be properly combined and aggregated within the model.
  - Justification: These assumptions are necessary for the mathematical operations performed by the `RiskCalculator` class to produce meaningful and interpretable risk scores. Allowing invalid weight or value ranges could lead to nonsensical or erroneous results.
- The `RiskCalculator` class assumes that the list of risk factors provided in the constructor is non-empty. This ensures that the risk calculation can be performed without encountering an empty set of risk factors.
  - Justification: An empty set of risk factors would prevent the model from generating any meaningful risk assessment, as there would be no inputs to calculate the overall risk score. This assumption ensures that the model can function as intended.

Assumptions Related to Risk Calculation:
- The `RiskCalculator` class assumes that the risk factors can be combined using a weighted sum, where the weight of each factor represents its relative importance or contribution to the overall risk.
  - Justification: The weighted sum approach is a common and well-established method for aggregating multiple risk factors into a single risk score. It allows the model to capture the varying degrees of impact that different risk factors have on the overall risk profile.
- The `RiskCalculator` class assumes that the total risk score can be normalized to a 0-1 scale, where 0 represents no risk and 1 represents the maximum possible risk.
  - Justification: Normalizing the risk score to a common scale facilitates the interpretation and comparison of risk assessments, both within the model and across different risk models or scenarios. This assumption ensures that the risk scores produced by the model can be easily understood and contextualized.

Assumptions Related to Risk Reporting:
- The `create_risk_report` function assumes that the `RiskCalculator` instance provided as input is valid and has been properly initialized with a set of risk factors.
  - Justification: The risk report generation relies on the accurate and complete risk assessment data produced by the `RiskCalculator`. This assumption ensures that the report accurately reflects the underlying risk calculations.
- The `create_risk_report` function assumes that the risk threshold provided is a valid value between 0 and 1, which is used to determine the risk status (high-risk or low-risk) in the generated report.
  - Justification: The risk threshold is a critical parameter for interpreting the risk assessment results. Ensuring that the threshold is within the valid range of 0 to 1 helps maintain the consistency and meaningfulness of the risk status classification.

Limitations and Potential Impact:
While the assumptions made in the model design and implementation are reasonable and well-justified, it is important to acknowledge their potential limitations and impact on the model's performance and applicability:

1. The model is limited to the specific set of risk factors and calculation methods implemented within the `complex_module.py` file. It does not have the flexibility to incorporate external data sources or more complex risk assessment methodologies.
2. The normalization of the risk score to a 0-1 scale may oversimplify the representation of risk, as it does not capture the nuances and relative magnitudes of different risk factors. This could lead to a loss of granularity in the risk assessment.
3. The model does not currently include any mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete risk factor data, which could impact the accuracy and reliability of the risk calculations and reporting.

To address these limitations and enhance the model's capabilities, future enhancements could include:
- Expanding the model to support a wider range of risk factors and calculation methods, potentially through the integration of external data sources or more advanced risk assessment algorithms.
- Exploring alternative risk score representations or scales that better capture the relative importance and magnitudes of different risk factors.
- Implementing robust data handling and error management strategies to address missing or invalid risk factor data.

By acknowledging these assumptions and limitations, and proactively identifying potential areas for improvement, the model can be further refined and strengthened to provide more comprehensive and reliable
