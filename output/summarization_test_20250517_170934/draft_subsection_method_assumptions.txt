2.3. Assumptions and Justifications

This section outlines the key assumptions made in the design and implementation of the risk calculation model, along with justifications for each assumption and a discussion of their potential impact.

Assumption 1: Risk Factors Have Valid Weights and Values
Justification: The `RiskFactor` class in the `complex_module.py` file assumes that the weight of each risk factor is between 0 and 1, and the value of each risk factor is greater than or equal to 0. This assumption ensures that the risk factors can be properly combined and aggregated by the `RiskCalculator` class without introducing invalid or nonsensical values.

Impact: If this assumption is violated, and risk factors with invalid weights or values are provided to the `RiskCalculator`, the model may produce inaccurate or misleading risk assessments. The `_validate_factors` method in the `RiskCalculator` class attempts to catch and report any such invalid risk factors, but it is dependent on this underlying assumption.

Assumption 2: Risk Factors List is Non-Empty
Justification: The `RiskCalculator` class in the `complex_module.py` file assumes that the list of `RiskFactor` instances provided during initialization is non-empty. This assumption ensures that the risk calculation can be performed and that the model has sufficient information to generate a meaningful risk assessment.

Impact: If this assumption is violated, and an empty list of risk factors is provided to the `RiskCalculator`, the model will not be able to calculate any risk scores or generate a risk report. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the consuming systems or applications.

Assumption 3: Database Table and Schema Consistency
Justification: The SQL query defined in the `query.sql` file assumes that the `users` table exists in the database and has the expected schema, with the `id`, `name`, `email`, and `created_at` columns. This assumption ensures that the query can be executed successfully and retrieve the desired user data.

Impact: If the underlying database table or schema does not match the assumptions made in the SQL query, the query will fail to execute correctly, and the consuming systems or applications will not be able to retrieve the necessary user data. This could lead to data inconsistencies or errors in the overall model or system.

Assumption 4: Compatibility of Configuration Settings
Justification: The `config.json` file defines several configuration settings, such as `debug`, `maxRetries`, and `timeout`, which are assumed to be compatible with the rest of the codebase and the consuming systems or applications. This assumption ensures that the configuration parameters can be properly utilized and applied throughout the system.

Impact: If the configuration settings defined in the `config.json` file are not compatible with the rest of the codebase or the consuming systems, it could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or suboptimal performance. The consuming code would need to handle any incompatibilities or mismatches in the configuration parameters.

Assumption 5: Consistent Styling and Layout in CSS
Justification: The `styles.css` file assumes that the HTML structure of the application matches the selectors and hierarchy defined in the styles. This assumption ensures that the visual styles are applied correctly and the desired layout and appearance are achieved.

Impact: If the HTML structure of the application does not align with the assumptions made in the CSS file, the styles may not be applied as expected, leading to visual inconsistencies or layout issues in the user interface. The consuming application would need to ensure that the HTML structure adheres to the assumptions made in the CSS file.

Overall, the key assumptions made in the design and implementation of this model are primarily related to the validity and consistency of the input data, the compatibility of configuration settings, and the alignment between the presentation layer and the underlying HTML structure. Careful consideration and validation of these assumptions are crucial to ensure the model's reliability, accuracy, and integration within the broader system or application.
