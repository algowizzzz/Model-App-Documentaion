**SUMMARY:**

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - This file serves as a configuration file for storing market data parameters required by the broader financial modeling system or application.
   - Its primary role is to provide a centralized location for defining and managing the market data inputs used across various components of the system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - The file does not contain any classes, functions, or methods. It is a JSON data file.
   - The file defines two dictionaries, "EQ_A" and "EQ_B", each representing a set of market data parameters for a specific asset or security.
   - Each dictionary contains the following key-value pairs:
     - **Purpose:** Store market data parameters for a specific asset or security.
     - **Key Operations:** None (data storage).
     - **Inputs:** None (data is hardcoded).
     - **Outputs:** The dictionaries themselves, containing the market data parameters.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - This file does not implement any algorithms or complex business logic. It serves as a data storage file.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file utilizes Python dictionaries to store the market data parameters for each asset or security.
   - The dictionaries have a predefined structure with keys representing specific market data parameters (e.g., "current_price", "volatility", "risk_free_rate", "dividend_yield").

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None (assuming this is a standalone configuration file).
   - **External:** None (assuming no external libraries are required to read or parse the JSON file).

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The file does not contain any explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities, as it is a static data file.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - **Assumptions:**
     - The market data parameters stored in this file are assumed to be accurate and up-to-date.
     - The structure of the dictionaries (keys and their corresponding data types) is assumed to be consistent across all assets or securities.
   - **Limitations:**
     - The market data parameters are hardcoded in this file, which may require manual updates or a separate process to keep the data current.
     - The file does not provide any mechanisms for data validation or error checking (e.g., ensuring parameter values are within expected ranges).
