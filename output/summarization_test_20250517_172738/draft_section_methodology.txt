2. Model Methodology

This section provides a detailed explanation of the theoretical basis, mathematical formulation, assumptions, and limitations of the risk calculation methodology implemented in the `complex_module.py` file.

2.1. Theoretical Basis
The risk calculation model in this codebase is based on the principles of weighted risk factor aggregation. The key theoretical concepts underpinning the methodology are:

- Risk Factor Representation: The model represents individual risk factors as instances of the `RiskFactor` class, which encapsulates the name, weight, value, and category of each risk factor.
- Weighted Risk Calculation: The risk score for each factor is calculated as the product of its weight and value, reflecting the relative importance and impact of the factor.
- Risk Aggregation: The total risk score is computed as the sum of the weighted risk factors, providing an overall assessment of the combined risk exposure.
- Risk Breakdown by Category: The model also calculates the risk scores for each risk category by summing the weighted impacts of the factors within each category, enabling a more granular analysis of the risk profile.

2.2. Mathematical Formulation
The core mathematical formulation of the risk calculation model is as follows:

1. Risk Factor Calculation:
   - For each `RiskFactor` instance `i`:
     - Risk Factor Score = `risk_factor.weight * risk_factor.value`

2. Total Risk Score Calculation:
   - Total Risk Score = Σ (Risk Factor Score for all `RiskFactor` instances)

3. Risk Breakdown by Category:
   - For each risk category `c`:
     - Risk Category Score = Σ (Risk Factor Score for all `RiskFactor` instances in category `c`)

The `RiskCalculator` class is responsible for implementing this mathematical logic, providing methods to calculate the total risk score, the risk breakdown by category, and validating the input risk factors.

2.3. Assumptions and Justifications
The key assumptions made in the design of this risk calculation model are:

1. **Valid Risk Factor Inputs**: The model assumes that the weight and value of each `RiskFactor` instance are valid, with the weight being between 0 and 1, and the value being greater than or equal to 0. This assumption is validated in the `_validate_factors` method of the `RiskCalculator` class.

2. **Non-empty Risk Factor List**: The `RiskCalculator` class assumes that the list of risk factors provided in the constructor is non-empty. This ensures that the risk calculation can be performed without encountering an empty set of factors.

These assumptions are necessary for the proper functioning of the risk calculation logic and to ensure the validity of the model outputs. Violations of these assumptions would result in errors or invalid results, which are handled by the validation process in the `RiskCalculator` class.

2.4. Limitations of the Methodology
The risk calculation methodology implemented in this codebase has the following inherent limitations:

1. **Static Risk Factor Structure**: The model assumes a fixed structure for risk factors, with each factor having a name, weight, value, and category. This limits the flexibility to handle more complex or dynamic risk factor representations, such as interdependent factors or factors with time-varying characteristics.

2. **Lack of External Data Handling**: The model does not have any mechanisms to handle external data sources or dependencies beyond the risk factors and threshold provided to the `RiskCalculator` class. This restricts the model's ability to incorporate real-time market data, economic indicators, or other external inputs that could enhance the risk assessment.

3. **Limited Scope**: The risk calculation and reporting functionality implemented in this codebase are tailored to the specific requirements outlined in the provided files. The model may not be suitable for more complex or diverse risk assessment scenarios that require additional features, such as scenario analysis, stress testing, or advanced risk aggregation techniques.

These limitations should be considered when evaluating the applicability and suitability of this risk calculation model for broader use cases within the organization. Potential enhancements or extensions to the model may be necessary to address these limitations and meet evolving business requirements.
