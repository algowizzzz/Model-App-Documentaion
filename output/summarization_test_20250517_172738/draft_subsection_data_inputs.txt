3.1. Input Data Sources and Specifications

This section details the various input data elements required by the risk calculation model, their sources, frequency, and format.

The model relies on the following key input data sources:

1. **Risk Factors**:
   - Source: The `RiskFactor` class defined within the `complex_module.py` file.
   - Description: The `RiskFactor` class represents a single risk factor, with attributes for the name, weight, value, and category of the risk factor.
   - Frequency: The risk factors are provided as a list to the `RiskCalculator` class, which processes them to generate the overall risk assessment. The frequency of updating the risk factors is dependent on the broader system or process that utilizes this model.
   - Format: The risk factors are passed to the `RiskCalculator` class as a list of `RiskFactor` objects, where each object has the following properties:
     - `name`: A string representing the name of the risk factor.
     - `weight`: A float value between 0 and 1, representing the weight or importance of the risk factor.
     - `value`: A float value greater than or equal to 0, representing the current value or magnitude of the risk factor.
     - `category`: A string representing the category or type of the risk factor (e.g., market risk, credit risk, operational risk).

2. **Risk Threshold**:
   - Source: The `RiskCalculator` class within the `complex_module.py` file.
   - Description: The risk threshold is a parameter that is used to determine whether the overall risk score is considered "high-risk" or "low-risk".
   - Frequency: The risk threshold is provided as an input to the `RiskCalculator` class and is expected to be set based on the specific requirements or risk appetite of the organization using this model.
   - Format: The risk threshold is a float value between 0 and 1, representing the maximum acceptable risk score.

The input data sources and their specifications are summarized in the following table:

| Data Element | Source | Frequency | Format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Risk Factors | `RiskFactor` class in `complex_module.py` | Dependent on the broader system/process | List of `RiskFactor` objects with `name`, `weight`, `value`, and `category` properties |
| Risk Threshold | `RiskCalculator` class in `complex_module.py` | Set based on organizational requirements | Float value between 0 and 1 |

It is important to note that the codebase summaries provided do not contain information about any other potential input data sources or specifications beyond the risk factors and risk threshold. If the model requires additional input data, such as market data, trade information, or other external data sources, those would need to be investigated and documented separately.
