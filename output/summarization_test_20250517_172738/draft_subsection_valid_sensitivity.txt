5.4. Sensitivity and Stress Testing

This section provides an analysis of the model's behavior under various input and parameter changes, as well as its performance under extreme conditions. Understanding the model's sensitivity and resilience is crucial for assessing its overall soundness and identifying potential areas for improvement.

Sensitivity Analysis
-------------------

The sensitivity analysis examines how changes in the model's input variables or parameters affect its outputs. This helps identify the key drivers of the model's results and quantify the impact of potential uncertainties or errors in the input data.

For the risk calculation model implemented in the `complex_module.py` file, the sensitivity analysis focuses on the following key aspects:

1. **Risk Factor Weights**: The `RiskCalculator` class in the `complex_module.py` file calculates the total risk score as a weighted sum of the individual risk factors. The sensitivity analysis evaluates how changes in the risk factor weights impact the overall risk score and the breakdown by risk category.

2. **Risk Factor Values**: The sensitivity analysis also examines the impact of variations in the individual risk factor values on the total risk score and category-level risk breakdowns. This helps understand the model's responsiveness to changes in the underlying risk data.

3. **Risk Threshold**: The `create_risk_report` function in the `complex_module.py` file uses a risk threshold to determine whether the overall risk is classified as "high-risk" or "low-risk". The sensitivity analysis investigates how changes in this threshold affect the risk classification and the resulting risk report.

The sensitivity analysis is conducted by systematically varying the input parameters (risk factor weights, values, and risk threshold) within reasonable ranges and observing the corresponding changes in the model's outputs. The results of this analysis are documented, including the magnitude of the output changes and the identification of the most influential input variables.

Stress Testing
--------------

Stress testing evaluates the model's performance under extreme or hypothetical conditions that go beyond the normal operating range. This helps assess the model's robustness and identify potential vulnerabilities or limitations.

For the risk calculation model, the stress testing focuses on the following scenarios:

1. **Extreme Risk Factor Values**: The stress testing examines the model's behavior when the risk factor values are set to their theoretical maximum or minimum values, even if these values are unlikely to occur in practice. This helps understand the model's ability to handle outliers or unexpected data.

2. **Highly Correlated Risk Factors**: The stress testing investigates the model's performance when the risk factors exhibit strong correlations or dependencies, which may not be captured in the normal operating conditions. This helps assess the model's ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships between risk factors.

3. **Sudden Market Shocks**: The stress testing simulates sudden and significant changes in the market or economic environment, such as a financial crisis or a major geopolitical event. This helps evaluate the model's resilience to extreme, low-probability scenarios.

The stress testing is conducted by applying the identified extreme or hypothetical conditions to the model and observing its behavior, including the magnitude of changes in the risk scores, the stability of the risk category breakdowns, and the overall risk classification. The results of the stress testing are documented, highlighting any significant deviations from the model's normal performance, potential vulnerabilities, and recommendations for model enhancements or risk mitigation strategies.

Conclusion
----------

The sensitivity and stress testing analyses provide valuable insights into the model's behavior, robustness, and limitations. The findings from these assessments are crucial for understanding the model's overall soundness, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that the model's outputs are reliable and appropriate for the intended use cases.
