3.1. Input Data Sources and Specifications

This section details the various input data elements, their sources, frequency, and format required by the model.

The model utilizes input data from several sources, including internal databases, vendor feeds, and configuration files. These data inputs are essential for the model's core functionality, which involves risk calculation and reporting.

3.1.1. Internal Database Sources
The model retrieves user data from the `users` database table, which is defined in the `query.sql` file. This table contains the following columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each user
- `name`: User's full name
- `email`: User's email address
- `created_at`: Timestamp of the user's account creation

The SQL query in `query.sql` selects the `name` and `email` columns from the `users` table, filtering for users created within the last 7 days and ordering the results by the `created_at` timestamp in descending order.

3.1.2. Vendor Data Feeds
The model also ingests risk factor data from a vendor-provided feed. This data is represented in the `data.xml` file, which contains the following structure:
- `root`: Top-level element
  - `person`: Represents an individual person
    - `name`: Person's full name
    - `age`: Person's age
    - `skills`: List of the person's skills
  - `metadata`: Provides additional information about the data
    - `created`: Timestamp of the data's creation
    - `version`: Version of the data

The `RiskFactor` class in the `complex_module.py` file is used to represent and process the risk factor data from the `data.xml` file.

3.1.3. Configuration Files
The model also relies on several configuration files to define project-level settings and dependencies. These files include:
- `config.json`: Stores general project configuration parameters, such as debug mode, maximum retries, and timeout values. This file also specifies external module dependencies required by the project.
- `invalid_template.json`: Defines the required sections and subsections for model configurations, providing a standardized format for organizing and documenting model implementations.
- `valid_template.json`: Specifies the structure for comprehensive model documentation, including sections for overview, implementation, and testing.

The configuration files are used to ensure consistent and standardized handling of project settings, model configurations, and documentation across the broader system.

3.1.4. Frequency and Format
The input data sources have the following frequency and format characteristics:
- Internal database (users table): Data is retrieved on-demand, with the SQL query in `query.sql` fetching users created within the last 7 days.
- Vendor data feed (data.xml): The `data.xml` file is assumed to be updated periodically by the vendor, with the `metadata` section indicating the creation timestamp and version of the data.
- Configuration files (JSON): The configuration files, such as `config.json`, `invalid_template.json`, and `valid_template.json`, are static files that are loaded at runtime and do not have a defined update frequency.

All input data is provided in structured formats, either as SQL queries, XML, or JSON, which can be easily parsed and processed by the model's components.

[Information regarding any additional input data sources or specifications not covered in the provided codebase summaries needs to be sourced/further investigated as it is not fully available.]
