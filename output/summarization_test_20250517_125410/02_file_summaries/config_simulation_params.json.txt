SUMMARY:

1. The main purpose of this file is to provide configuration parameters for a simulation run, specifically related to Potential Future Exposure (PFE) calculations.

2. Key components:
   - `simulation_id`: A string that identifies the specific simulation run.
   - `num_paths`: An integer that specifies the number of Monte Carlo simulation paths to be generated for the PFE calculation.
   - `pfe_quantile`: A float value representing the quantile level for the PFE calculation, typically set to a high value like 0.95 or 0.99 to capture extreme scenarios.
   - `output_directory`: A string that specifies the directory where the simulation results will be stored.

3. Important relationships or dependencies:
   - This file does not have any direct dependencies on other components or modules.
   - However, it is likely that the values specified in this configuration file will be used by other parts of the application or simulation engine to perform the PFE calculations and generate the necessary output.

4. Notable algorithms or patterns:
   - This file does not contain any algorithms or specific patterns.
   - It is a simple JSON configuration file that provides input parameters for the PFE simulation process.

Overall, this file serves as a centralized location for configuring the key parameters required for running a PFE simulation. It allows users or administrators to easily modify the simulation settings, such as the number of paths, quantile level, and output directory, without having to change the application code directly.
