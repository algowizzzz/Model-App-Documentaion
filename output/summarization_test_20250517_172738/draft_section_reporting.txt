6. Reporting and Output

This section provides a detailed overview of the model's key outputs and how they are reported and interpreted.

6.1. Description of Output Files/Reports

The primary output of the risk calculation model is a comprehensive risk report, which is generated by the `create_risk_report` function in the `complex_module.py` file. This report provides the following information:

- **Total Risk Score**: The overall risk score calculated by the `RiskCalculator` class, which represents the aggregated impact of all the risk factors.
- **Risk Breakdown by Category**: A breakdown of the risk scores for each category of risk factors, as calculated by the `get_risk_breakdown` method in the `RiskCalculator` class.
- **Risk Status**: The status of the risk, which is determined based on the total risk score and a predefined risk threshold. The report will indicate whether the risk is "High Risk" or "Low Risk".
- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the risk report was generated.

The risk report is returned as a dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    "timestamp": "2023-04-24 15:30:45",
    "total_risk": 0.78,
    "risk_breakdown": {
        "market": 0.45,
        "credit": 0.22,
        "operational": 0.11
    },
    "risk_status": "High Risk"
}
```

This report can be used by the intended users of the model to understand the current risk profile and make informed decisions based on the provided information.

6.2. Interpretation of Results

The risk report generated by the model should be interpreted as follows:

- **Total Risk Score**: The total risk score is a normalized value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents no risk and 1 represents the maximum possible risk. A higher total risk score indicates a higher overall risk exposure.
- **Risk Breakdown by Category**: The breakdown of risk scores by category provides insight into the relative contribution of different types of risk factors to the overall risk. This information can help identify the areas of the portfolio or business that require the most attention or mitigation efforts.
- **Risk Status**: The risk status, determined based on the total risk score and a predefined risk threshold, indicates whether the overall risk level is considered "High Risk" or "Low Risk". This classification can be used to trigger appropriate risk management actions or escalate the risk to relevant stakeholders.
- **Timestamp**: The timestamp of the risk report is important for understanding the timeliness of the information and ensuring that decisions are made based on the most up-to-date risk assessment.

It is important to note that the interpretation of the risk report should be done in the context of the model's purpose, scope, and limitations, as outlined in the earlier sections of the documentation. The users of the model should be aware of any assumptions, constraints, or known issues that may affect the reliability or applicability of the reported results.
