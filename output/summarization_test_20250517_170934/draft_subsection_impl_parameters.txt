4.3. Key Parameters and Calibration

This section outlines the key parameters and calibration methods used in the risk calculation model implemented in the `complex_module.py` file.

The core of the risk calculation logic is encapsulated in the `RiskCalculator` class, which takes a list of `RiskFactor` objects as input and computes the overall risk score. The `RiskFactor` class represents a single risk factor, with attributes for the factor's name, weight, value, and category.

Key Parameters:
- **Risk Factors**: The `RiskCalculator` class operates on a list of `RiskFactor` objects, each representing a distinct risk factor. The key parameters for each risk factor are:
  - `name`: A string identifying the risk factor.
  - `weight`: A float value between 0 and 1, representing the relative importance or contribution of the risk factor to the overall risk score.
  - `value`: A float value greater than or equal to 0, representing the magnitude or severity of the risk factor.
  - `category`: A string identifying the category or type of the risk factor (e.g., "market risk", "credit risk", "operational risk").
- **Risk Threshold**: The `RiskCalculator` class also takes a risk threshold parameter, which is used to determine whether the overall risk score is considered "high-risk" or "low-risk" in the generated risk report.

Calibration:
The `RiskCalculator` class does not perform any automated calibration of the risk factor parameters. The weights, values, and categories for the risk factors are assumed to be pre-determined and provided as input to the class.

However, the `_validate_factors` method in the `RiskCalculator` class does perform some basic validation on the risk factor parameters:
- It checks that the weight of each risk factor is between 0 and 1.
- It checks that the value of each risk factor is greater than or equal to 0.

If any of the risk factors are found to be invalid, the `_validate_factors` method returns a list of error messages describing the issues. These validation checks help ensure that the input risk factors are within the expected ranges and can be properly processed by the risk calculation logic.

The specific configuration of the risk factors, including their names, weights, values, and categories, is not provided in the codebase summaries. This information would need to be sourced from additional documentation or the actual implementation of the model.

[Information regarding the specific risk factors and their configuration parameters needs to be sourced/further investigated as it is not fully available in the provided codebase summaries.]
