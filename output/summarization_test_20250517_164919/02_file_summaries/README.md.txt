SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to serve as the main documentation for the "Monte Carlo PFE Calculator for Equity TRS" project.
   - This file provides an overview of the project's structure, workflow, and key components, making it a crucial reference for understanding the system's functionality and implementation.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - `config/`: Responsible for loading trade data, market data, and simulation parameters from JSON files.
   - `data_management/`: Modules for loading and managing input data.
   - `financial_instruments/`: Modules for defining and valuing financial instruments, such as Equity Total Return Swaps (TRS).
   - `pfe_calculation/`: Modules for calculating exposures and aggregating Potential Future Exposure (PFE).
   - `reporting/`: Modules for writing output results.
   - `simulation_engine/`: Modules for the Monte Carlo simulation and underlying stochastic processes (Geometric Brownian Motion).
   - `main_pfe_runner.py`: The main script to execute the PFE calculation.
   - `pfe_results/`: Directory to store output files.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - This file does not contain any core algorithms or significant business logic. It serves as a high-level overview and documentation of the project's structure and workflow.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - This file does not directly define or manipulate any specific data structures. It provides a general description of the project's components and their responsibilities.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** The file references various modules and directories within the project, such as `config/`, `data_management/`, `financial_instruments/`, `pfe_calculation/`, `reporting/`, and `simulation_engine/`.
   - **External:** The file does not mention any external libraries or packages used in the project.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - This file does not contain any information about error handling or logging mechanisms. It is a documentation file and does not implement any specific functionality.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - This file does not make any assumptions or have any limitations specific to its own implementation. It is a high-level documentation file that describes the overall project structure and workflow.

In summary, this README.md file serves as the primary documentation for the "Monte Carlo PFE Calculator for Equity TRS" project. It provides an overview of the project's structure, key components, and the general workflow for calculating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) for a portfolio of Equity Total Return Swaps (TRS) using Monte Carlo simulation. The file does not contain any core algorithms or data structures, but rather serves as a reference for understanding the project's organization and responsibilities of its various modules.
