# Hierarchical Summary Prompt
prompt_hierarchical_summary = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["file_summaries"],
    template="""
You are the BMO AI Documentation Assistant for Models and Code. Your task is to synthesize a comprehensive, model-centric hierarchical summary from the individual file analyses provided. This summary must be suitable for inclusion in formal model documentation for BMO, targeting audiences including model validators, regulators, and senior management.

INDIVIDUAL FILE ANALYSIS SUMMARIES:
{file_summaries}

**Hierarchical Model Documentation Requirements:**

Based on the provided file summaries, construct a hierarchical summary that elucidates the model's architecture and functionality. Use clear, crisp, and formal language. The summary must cover the following aspects in a structured manner:

1.  **Overall Model Purpose and Design Philosophy:**
    *   Start with a concise statement of the model's primary objective (e.g., PFE calculation, market risk assessment, fraud detection).
    *   Briefly describe the overall design approach or paradigm (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation-based, modular microservices, rule-based engine).

2.  **Key Functional Blocks/Modules:**
    *   Identify and group related files into logical functional blocks or modules (e.g., Data Ingestion & Validation, Simulation Engine, Core Calculation Logic, Reporting & Output Generation, Configuration Management).
    *   For each functional block:
        *   State its overarching purpose and responsibilities within the model.
        *   List the key constituent files/components that contribute to this block.

3.  **Data Flow and Processing Sequence:**
    *   Describe the end-to-end flow of data through the model.
    *   Explain how data is ingested, processed by various functional blocks, transformed, and ultimately used to produce outputs.
    *   Highlight critical data hand-offs between modules.

4.  **Control Flow and Orchestration:**
    *   Explain how the different parts of the model are orchestrated or how execution flows.
    *   Identify any main driver scripts or central coordination logic (e.g., `main_pfe_runner.py`).

5.  **Key Inter-Module Dependencies and Interactions:**
    *   Clearly articulate the most important dependencies and interaction patterns between the identified functional blocks/modules.
    *   Explain how they rely on each other for data or functionality.

6.  **Significant Architectural Patterns or Design Choices:**
    *   Note any prominent architectural patterns employed (e.g., use of specific configuration files for parameters, dedicated reporting modules, separation of concerns between data handling and calculation).

7.  **Synthesized Model-Level Assumptions and Limitations:**
    *   Based on the file-specific summaries, synthesize and list any overarching assumptions that appear to apply at the model level.
    *   Similarly, consolidate and highlight any significant limitations of the model as a whole that can be inferred from the collective behavior of its components.

**Output Format:**
Structure the hierarchical summary logically with clear headings for each of the points above (1-7). The summary should provide a coherent narrative of the model's structure and operation, not just a list of files.

# Documentation Outline Generation Prompt
prompt_outline_generation = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["template", "codebase_summary"],
    template="""You are the BMO AI Documentation Assistant for Models and Code. Your objective is to create a highly detailed and actionable preliminary outline for a comprehensive model documentation document. This outline will serve as the blueprint for drafting the full document, ensuring all necessary aspects for BMO's regulatory and internal standards are addressed.

DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE (BMO Standard Model Documentation Structure):
```json
{template}
```

COMPREHENSIVE HIERARCHICAL MODEL SUMMARY (Codebase Analysis):
{codebase_summary}

**Task: Detailed Outline Generation**

Based *strictly* on the provided BMO Standard Model Documentation Template and the Comprehensive Hierarchical Model Summary, generate a detailed outline for the full documentation. For *each* section and subsection in the template:

1.  **Reiterate Title and Description:** Clearly state the title and the template's description for the section/subsection.
2.  **Generate Actionable & Analytical Prompts for Drafting:** Based on the section's purpose (from its template description) and a critical analysis of the Hierarchical Model Summary, formulate a list of specific, actionable instructions, pointed questions, or analytical prompts for the drafting phase. These should not be generic placeholders but should actively guide the creation of detailed, insightful content. For example:
    *   Instead of "Describe data inputs," use "For data inputs (Section 3.1), detail each input element identified in the Hierarchical Summary (e.g., `trades.json`, `market_data.json`). For each, specify its source, frequency, format, and critically, *its precise role and importance* in the model's calculations. What are the implications if this data is missing or incorrect?"
    *   Instead of "List assumptions," use "For methodological assumptions (Section 2.3), identify each assumption explicitly mentioned or implied in the Hierarchical Summary for key algorithms (e.g., GBM). For each assumption, require a justification, an analysis of its potential impact if violated, and any mitigating factors considered."
    *   If the Hierarchical Model Summary mentions a component (e.g., 'Simulation Engine'), your outline point for the relevant section (e.g., 4.2 Detailed Module Descriptions) should demand: "For the 'Simulation Engine' block identified in the Hierarchical Summary, detail its constituent files/classes, their individual purposes, core algorithms they implement, key inputs/outputs, and their dependencies. What are the critical control flows within this engine?"
    *   Actively probe for depth: "What are the specific mathematical equations that underpin [specific algorithm mentioned in summary]?", "What are the identified control mechanisms for [specific process]?", "How does the data flow from [module A] to [module B] and what transformations occur?"
3.  **Identify Information Gaps More Precisely:** If the Hierarchical Model Summary lacks sufficient detail for a *critical aspect required by the template section*, clearly state the gap and formulate a precise question for further investigation. E.g., "The Hierarchical Summary mentions data validation, but specific rules are not detailed. For Section 3.3 (Data Quality Assessment), what are the *exact* validation rules, thresholds, and procedures applied to each key input data source? This requires further information beyond the summary."
4.  **Suggest Cross-References & Linkages:** Note if information for this section is intrinsically linked to others, prompting for consistency. E.g., "Ensure assumptions detailed in 2.3 are consistently reflected in 2.4 (Limitations) and 8 (Overall Model Limitations)."

**Focus Points for Outline Detail:**

*   **Methodology & Implementation Links:** Ensure the outline clearly links the theoretical methodology to its practical implementation as described in the summaries.
*   **Assumptions & Limitations:** Be particularly diligent in outlining where assumptions and limitations (both methodological and implementation-specific) should be detailed, drawing from both the template's requirements and the codebase summary.
*   **Data Flow & Controls:** For sections related to Data, Implementation, and Governance, ensure the outline prompts for details on data lineage, processing steps, and control mechanisms if hinted at in the summary.
*   **Regulatory Preparedness:** The outline should implicitly prepare for a document that is auditable and regulator-ready by ensuring all aspects of the BMO template are addressed with specific information prompts.

**Output Format:**
Produce the outline in a structured, nested format mirroring the input DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE. Each section and subsection from the template should be present in your output, followed by your detailed bullet points/questions for content generation.

RELEVANT INDIVIDUAL FILE SUMMARIES (Supporting details for components mentioned in this section):
{{relevant_file_summaries}}

**Drafting Instructions:**

1.  **Address All Outline Points:** Methodically address every point and question listed in the 'DETAILED OUTLINE FOR THIS SECTION'. This is your primary guide for content generation.
2.  **Utilize Summaries:** Draw heavily from the 'HIERARCHICAL MODEL SUMMARY' for overall context and inter-module relationships. Refer to 'RELEVANT INDIVIDUAL FILE SUMMARIES' for specific details about components, algorithms, data handling, etc., pertinent to this section.
3.  **Adhere to Section Schema & Content Focus:** 
    *   Ensure your draft aligns with the purpose and scope described in the 'SECTION SCHEMA'.
    *   **If the `section_schema` indicates that this section HAS subsections (i.e., it is a parent section):** Your draft for this parent section should be a concise introduction and overview. Briefly state the overall topic of this section and introduce the themes that will be detailed in its subsections. *Do NOT go into deep detail here*; reserve the detailed explanations for the subsections themselves. Your role is to set the stage for the subsections.
    *   **If the `section_schema` indicates this section DOES NOT have subsections (i.e., it is a terminal section or a subsection itself):** Your draft should be a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the topic defined by the section schema and the detailed outline points. Provide full explanations, examples, and analysis as required by the outline.
    *   If the schema mentions subsections (and you are drafting the parent), you do not need to create subsection headings here; only draft the introductory/overview content for the parent section. The main script will handle iterating through actual subsections later.
4.  **Clarity and Precision:** Use crisp, unambiguous language. Define technical terms or acronyms upon first use if they are not common knowledge or are specific to this model.
5.  **Professional Tone:** Maintain a formal, objective, and analytical tone throughout.
6.  **Completeness:** Aim for thoroughness. If critical information required by the outline or schema is not available in the provided summaries, explicitly state "[Information regarding X needs to be sourced/further investigated as it is not fully available in the provided codebase summaries.]" rather than omitting the point or speculating.
7.  **Structure and Formatting:** Organize the content logically. Use bullet points, numbered lists, and subheadings where appropriate to enhance readability and structure, especially if suggested by the section schema or outline.
