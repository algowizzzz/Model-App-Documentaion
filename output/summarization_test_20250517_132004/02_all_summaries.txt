File: simulation_engine/gbm_model.py

**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
This file contains an implementation of the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices over time. Its primary purpose is to provide a reusable component for generating multiple paths of asset price trajectories based on the GBM model. This simulation engine component can be utilized within broader financial modeling systems or applications that require asset price simulations, such as option pricing models, portfolio risk analysis, or Monte Carlo simulations.

**2. Key Components and Functionality:**
- **Class: GBMProcess**
    - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the GBM process for simulating asset prices.
    - **Key Operations:**
        - Initializes the GBM process with given parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta).
        - Generates multiple asset price paths over specified time steps using the GBM equation.
    - **Inputs:**
        - Initial price (float): The starting price of the asset.
        - Drift (float): The expected rate of return (e.g., risk-free rate - dividend yield).
        - Volatility (float): The volatility of the asset price.
        - Time delta (float): The time increment for each step (in years).
        - Number of steps (int): The number of time steps to simulate for each path.
        - Number of paths (int): The number of distinct paths to generate.
    - **Outputs:**
        - numpy.ndarray: An array of shape (num_steps + 1, num_paths) containing the simulated asset prices, including the initial price at t=0.

**3. Core Algorithms and Logic:**
The core algorithm implemented in this file is the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process for simulating asset prices. The GBM equation used is:

```
S(t+dt) = S(t) * exp((mu - 0.5 * sigma^2) * dt + sigma * sqrt(dt) * Z)
```

where `Z` is a standard normal random variable. This equation is applied iteratively to generate asset price paths over multiple time steps.

**4. Data Structures:**
The primary data structure used is a NumPy array to store and return the simulated asset price paths. The array has a shape of `(num_steps + 1, num_paths)`, where each column represents a distinct price path, and each row represents a time step.

**5. Dependencies:**
- **Internal:** None.
- **External:**
    - NumPy: A fundamental Python library for scientific computing, used for efficient numerical operations and random number generation.

**6. Error Handling and Logging:**
- Error Handling: The `generate_paths` method includes a check to ensure that the `num_steps` and `num_paths` parameters are positive integers. If either is non-positive, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate error message.
- Logging: The file includes `print` statements to log the initialization of the `GBMProcess` instance and the successful generation of price paths. However, no dedicated logging library is used.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
- Assumptions:
    - The input parameters (initial price, drift, volatility, time delta) are valid and within reasonable ranges for financial modeling purposes.
    - The GBM process is an appropriate model for simulating asset prices in the given context.
- Limitations:
    - The GBM process assumes constant drift and volatility over time, which may not accurately reflect real-world asset price dynamics.
    - The simulation does not account for potential market events, regime shifts, or other factors that could impact asset price trajectories.

File: financial_instruments/equity_trs.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to represent and value an Equity Total Return Swap (TRS) financial instrument.
   - Its specific role is to provide a self-contained class for modeling and calculating the mark-to-market (MtM) and exposure values of an Equity TRS contract, which is likely a component of a larger risk management or pricing system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **Class: EquityTRS**
     - **Purpose:** Encapsulates the representation and valuation of an Equity Total Return Swap.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes the TRS contract with trade details (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Calculates the MtM values of the TRS given current underlying price paths.
       - Calculates the exposure values from the MtM values.
     - **Inputs:**
       - Trade details dictionary (notional, initial price, trade type).
       - Current underlying price paths as a NumPy array.
     - **Outputs:**
       - MtM values as a NumPy array.
       - Exposure values as a NumPy array.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The MtM calculation is based on the change in the underlying equity price relative to the initial price at inception, multiplied by the notional amount. This is a standard approach for valuing a TRS.
   - The exposure calculation follows the typical definition of exposure being the maximum of 0 and the MtM value, assuming positive MtM means the counterparty owes the TRS holder.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure is a Python dictionary used to initialize the EquityTRS class with trade details.
   - NumPy arrays are used to represent the current underlying price paths and store the calculated MtM and exposure values.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy library for numerical operations and array manipulation.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `__init__` method of the EquityTRS class performs a validation check on the `trade_type` input and raises a `ValueError` if it is invalid.
   - The file uses `print` statements to log the creation of the EquityTRS instrument and provide example MtM values, but does not implement a dedicated logging library.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that the funding leg (fixed or floating rate payments) of the TRS is netted against the equity leg at each valuation date, focusing solely on the change in equity value.
   - The exposure calculation assumes that positive MtM values indicate the counterparty owes the TRS holder, which may not hold true in certain scenarios or conventions.
   - The file does not handle more complex features of TRS contracts, such as interim resets, margin calculations, or other adjustments.

File: pfe_calculation/pfe_computer.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to provide a class for calculating the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) at a given quantile from a set of exposure paths.
   - This file appears to be a standalone component responsible for a specific calculation step within a broader risk management or counterparty credit risk modeling system.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **PFEQuantileCalculator** (class)
     - **Purpose:** Calculate the PFE profile (a vector of PFE values over time) at a specified quantile from exposure paths.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Initializes with a quantile value between 0 and 1.
       - Calculates the PFE at each time step as the specified quantile of positive exposures across paths.
       - Ensures PFE values are non-negative.
     - **Inputs:** A 2D NumPy array representing exposure paths (time steps, paths).
     - **Outputs:** A 1D NumPy array representing the PFE profile over time.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The core algorithm implemented is the calculation of the PFE profile at a given quantile using NumPy's `np.percentile` function.
   - The PFE at each time step is computed as the specified quantile (e.g., 95th percentile) of positive exposures across all paths for that time step.
   - A non-negativity constraint is enforced on the PFE values using `np.maximum`.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The primary data structure used is a 2D NumPy array representing exposure paths, with rows representing time steps and columns representing individual paths.
   - The output is a 1D NumPy array representing the PFE profile over time.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** None.
   - **External:** NumPy (for array operations and percentile calculation).

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - A `ValueError` is raised if the input quantile is not between 0 and 1 (exclusive).
   - A `ValueError` is raised if the input exposure paths array is not 2D.
   - Print statements are used for logging the initialization of the `PFEQuantileCalculator` and the successful calculation of the PFE profile.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that the input exposure paths array has a specific shape: (num_time_steps + 1, num_paths), where the first row represents exposures at time 0 (usually 0).
   - The file does not handle any missing or invalid values in the input exposure paths array.
   - The PFE calculation assumes that exposures are non-negative, although it enforces non-negativity on the output PFE profile.

File: pfe_calculation/exposure_aggregator.py

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file is to provide functionality for aggregating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades.
   - Within the broader model or system, this file likely plays a role in calculating and reporting portfolio-level risk metrics, specifically related to counterparty credit risk and exposure management.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - **Class: TradeAggregator**
     - **Purpose:** Aggregates PFE profiles across multiple trades.
     - **Key Operations:**
       - Stores individual trade PFE profiles in a dictionary.
       - Implements a simple summation method for aggregating PFE profiles.
     - **Inputs:**
       - `trade_id` (str): Unique identifier for a trade.
       - `pfe_profile` (numpy.ndarray): PFE profile for a specific trade.
     - **Outputs:**
       - `all_trade_pfe_profiles` (dict): Dictionary containing individual trade PFE profiles.
       - `aggregated_pfe_profile` (numpy.ndarray): Aggregated PFE profile across all trades.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method implements a basic aggregation approach by summing the PFE profiles of all trades at each time step.
   - This method includes a check to ensure that all PFE profiles have the same length before summation.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The `all_trade_pfe_profiles` dictionary stores individual trade PFE profiles, with trade IDs as keys and numpy arrays as values.
   - The `aggregated_pfe_profile` attribute is a numpy array representing the aggregated PFE profile across all trades.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **External:** The file imports the `numpy` library for working with numerical arrays.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The `add_trade_pfe_profile` method prints a warning message if a PFE profile for a trade ID is being overwritten.
   - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method raises a `ValueError` if the PFE profiles have different lengths.
   - The file uses `print` statements for logging various events and messages.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file assumes that PFE profiles are represented as numpy arrays of equal length across all trades.
   - The simple summation approach implemented in `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` is noted as generally not being the correct way to calculate portfolio PFE due to netting effects, and is provided as a basic example.
   - The file does not implement more complex aggregation methods, such as netting or considering portfolio effects, which are mentioned as being out of scope for this "bare-minimum" example.
