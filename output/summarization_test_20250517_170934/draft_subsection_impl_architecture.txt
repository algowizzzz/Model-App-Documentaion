4.1. System Architecture

The system architecture for this model is composed of several key components that work together to provide the core functionality. The high-level overview of the system architecture is as follows:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - The presentation layer is responsible for the visual styling and layout of the web application's user interface. This is handled by the `styles.css` file, which defines the styles for the main container, header, and other UI elements.
   - The `app.js` file serves as a test JavaScript file to verify the handling of non-Python files within the codebase.

2. **Data and Configuration Management**:
   - The `config.json` file stores project-level configuration settings and dependencies, such as debug mode, maximum retries, and timeout values.
   - The `data.xml` file represents structured data related to persons, including their names, ages, and skills. This data source can be used to load and access person-related information.

3. **Modeling and Calculation**:
   - The core of the system's functionality is implemented in the `complex_module.py` file, which contains the `RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator` classes.
   - The `RiskFactor` class represents a single risk factor with its name, weight, value, and category. The `RiskCalculator` class handles the calculation and aggregation of risk scores based on a list of risk factors.
   - The `create_risk_report` function in `complex_module.py` generates a comprehensive risk report based on the `RiskCalculator` instance.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - The `test_sample.py` file provides a set of Python structures and functions for testing and demonstration purposes, including a simple function, a test class with a nested function, and a global constant.
   - The `invalid_syntax.py` file contains Python code with invalid syntax, serving as an example or test case for identifying and analyzing code with syntax errors.
   - The `invalid_template.json` and `valid_template.json` files define template structures for model configurations and documentation, respectively, specifying the required sections and subsections.

5. **Miscellaneous**:
   - The `readme.md` file is a test markdown file to verify how the loader handles non-parseable files.
   - The `query.sql` file defines a SQL query that retrieves user data from a database table, including a `CREATE TABLE` statement and a `SELECT` query with filtering and sorting.

The overall system architecture demonstrates a diverse set of components, ranging from presentation-related files (CSS and JavaScript) to data management (configuration and XML), modeling and calculation (risk assessment), and testing/validation (Python modules and JSON templates). This suggests a web application or system that requires robust modeling, testing, and documentation capabilities.

The interactions between these components are as follows:

- The presentation layer (CSS and JavaScript) provides the visual and interactive elements for the user interface, which may consume data or results from the modeling and calculation components.
- The data and configuration management components supply the necessary data and settings for the modeling and calculation components to operate.
- The modeling and calculation components, particularly the `RiskFactor` and `RiskCalculator` classes, implement the core logic for risk assessment and reporting.
- The testing and validation components ensure the correctness and reliability of the system's functionality, including the modeling and calculation components.
- The miscellaneous components, such as the SQL query and the markdown file, provide additional utility and support for the overall system.

The system architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the addition or modification of components as needed to meet the evolving requirements of the model and the broader application or system.
