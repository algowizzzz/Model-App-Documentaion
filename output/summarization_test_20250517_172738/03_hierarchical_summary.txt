Hierarchical Summary:

1. **Codebase Overview**
   - The codebase consists of three files: `config.json`, `complex_module.py`, and `app.js`.
   - The codebase appears to be part of a larger system or model, with the files serving different purposes and responsibilities.

2. **Configuration Management**
   - `config.json` file
     - Purpose: Defines the configuration settings for a test project.
     - Key Components:
       - Project metadata (name, version, description)
       - Test project settings (debug mode, max retries, timeout)
       - External dependencies required by the test project
     - Relationship: This configuration file is likely used by other components or modules within the codebase to control the behavior and execution of the test project.

3. **Risk Calculation and Reporting**
   - `complex_module.py` file
     - Purpose: Implements a risk calculation system with multiple components and nested structures.
     - Key Components:
       - `RiskFactor` class: Represents a single risk factor with its name, weight, value, and category.
       - `RiskCalculator` class: Handles the calculation and aggregation of risk scores based on a list of risk factors.
       - `create_risk_report` function: Generates a comprehensive risk report based on a `RiskCalculator` instance.
     - Relationship: This module is likely a core component within a broader model or system, responsible for handling the complex logic of combining multiple risk factors and producing both detailed and summary risk assessments.

4. **Test Components**
   - `app.js` file
     - Purpose: Serves as a test JavaScript file to verify the parseable handling of non-Python files.
     - Key Components:
       - `TestClass`: Represents a test class with a single value property and a `doubleValue` method.
       - `testFunction`: Represents a test function that takes two parameters and returns a string.
     - Relationship: This file is likely used for testing or demonstration purposes within the broader codebase and does not have a direct relationship with the other files.

Overall, the codebase appears to be part of a larger system or model, with the files serving different responsibilities:

- `config.json` handles the configuration management for the test project.
- `complex_module.py` implements the core risk calculation and reporting functionality, which is likely a critical component within the broader system.
- `app.js` provides test components for verifying the handling of non-Python files, but does not have a direct relationship with the other files.

The codebase seems to follow a modular design, with each file focusing on a specific set of responsibilities. This separation of concerns allows for better maintainability, testability, and potential reuse of the individual components within the broader system.
