**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
The file `config/simulation_params.json` serves as a configuration file that specifies parameters for a simulation process. Its primary purpose is to provide a centralized location for defining key simulation settings, enabling easy modification and control over the simulation behavior.

This file likely plays a role within a broader risk management or financial modeling system, specifically contributing to the configuration and execution of simulations or scenario analyses.

**2. Key Components and Functionality:**
The file does not contain any classes, functions, or methods. Instead, it consists of a JSON object with the following key-value pairs:

- `simulation_id` (string):
    - **Purpose:** Uniquely identifies the specific simulation run.
    - **Value:** `"PFE_Run_Complex_Test_001"`

- `num_paths` (integer):
    - **Purpose:** Specifies the number of simulation paths or scenarios to be generated.
    - **Value:** `100`

- `pfe_quantile` (float):
    - **Purpose:** Defines the quantile or confidence level for calculating the Potential Future Exposure (PFE).
    - **Value:** `0.95`

- `output_directory` (string):
    - **Purpose:** Specifies the directory path where simulation results or outputs will be stored.
    - **Value:** `"pfe_results"`

**3. Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
This file does not contain any core algorithms or significant business logic. It serves as a configuration file, providing input parameters for the simulation process.

**4. Data Structures:**
The file utilizes a JSON object as its primary data structure, containing key-value pairs for the simulation parameters.

**5. Dependencies:**
- **Internal:** None (assuming this is a standalone configuration file).
- **External:** None.

**6. Error Handling and Logging:**
The file does not implement any explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities, as it is a static configuration file.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
- **Assumptions:**
    - The simulation process expects and correctly interprets the provided configuration parameters.
    - The specified `output_directory` path is valid and accessible for writing simulation results.
- **Limitations:**
    - The configuration parameters are hard-coded within the file, limiting the ability to dynamically modify them without editing the file directly.
    - The file does not provide any validation or error checking for the provided parameter values, potentially allowing invalid or inconsistent configurations.
