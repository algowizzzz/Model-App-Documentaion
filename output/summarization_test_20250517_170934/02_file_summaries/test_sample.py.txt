SUMMARY:

1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file, `test_sample.py`, is to provide a set of Python structures and functions for testing and demonstration purposes.
   - This file serves as a sample or template for understanding various Python programming concepts, such as functions, classes, and data structures, within a self-contained and easily testable environment.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**

   - **`simple_function(param1: str, param2: int = 42) -> str`**:
     - Purpose: Provides a simple function that returns a greeting string.
     - Key Operations: Concatenates the input `param1` (a string) with a default `param2` (an integer) to create a greeting message.
     - Inputs: `param1` (a string), `param2` (an integer with a default value of 42).
     - Outputs: A greeting string.

   - **`TestClass`**:
     - Purpose: Defines a test class with methods and a nested function.
     - Key Operations:
       - `__init__(self, value: int)`: Initializes the class with a given `value` (an integer).
       - `outer_method(self, x: List[int]) -> Dict[str, int]`: Calls a nested function `nested_function` to process a list of integers `x` and returns a dictionary with the sum and the original `value`.
       - `nested_function(items: List[int]) -> int`: A nested function that calculates the sum of a list of integers.
       - `doubled_value` (property): Returns the `value` property multiplied by 2.
     - Inputs: `value` (an integer) for initialization, `x` (a list of integers) for the `outer_method`.
     - Outputs: A dictionary with the sum of `x` and the original `value` for `outer_method`, and the doubled `value` for the `doubled_value` property.

   - **`GLOBAL_CONSTANT: str`**:
     - Purpose: Defines a global constant string variable.

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
   - The file does not contain any complex algorithms or significant business logic. It primarily demonstrates the use of basic Python structures, such as functions, classes, and a nested function, without any file-specific core algorithms or logic.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file utilizes the following data structures:
     - `List[int]`: Used as input for the `outer_method` of the `TestClass`.
     - `Dict[str, int]`: Used as the return type of the `outer_method` of the `TestClass`.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** The file does not have any internal dependencies within the codebase.
   - **External:** The file imports the `typing` module, which provides type hints for the Python language.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The file does not contain any explicit error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
   - Assumptions:
     - The file assumes that the input parameters for the `simple_function` and `outer_method` are of the correct types (string and list of integers, respectively).
   - Limitations:
     - The file does not have any file-specific limitations. It serves as a simple demonstration of Python structures without any inherent limitations.
