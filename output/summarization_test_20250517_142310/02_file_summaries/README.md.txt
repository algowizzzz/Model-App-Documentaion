1. **Overall Purpose and Role:**
   - The primary purpose of this file (`README.md`) is to provide an overview and documentation for the Monte Carlo PFE Calculator for Equity TRS project.
   - This file serves as a high-level introduction and guide to the project's structure, workflow, and components. It does not contain any executable code but rather acts as a reference for understanding the project's functionality and organization.

2. **Key Components and Functionality:**
   - The file does not define any classes, functions, or methods directly. Instead, it outlines the different modules and directories that make up the project:
     - `config/`: Contains JSON files for trade data, market data, and simulation parameters.
     - `data_management/`: Modules for loading and managing input data.
     - `financial_instruments/`: Modules for defining and valuing financial instruments (e.g., Equity TRS).
     - `pfe_calculation/`: Modules for calculating exposures and aggregating PFE.
     - `reporting/`: Modules for writing output results.
     - `simulation_engine/`: Modules for the Monte Carlo simulation and underlying stochastic processes (GBM).
     - `main_pfe_runner.py`: The main script to execute the PFE calculation.
     - `pfe_results/`: (Will be created to store output)

3. **Core Algorithms and Logic:**
   - The file describes the overall workflow and high-level steps involved in the PFE calculation process, which includes:
     - Simulating price paths using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model.
     - Valuing trades (Equity TRS) for each simulated price path.
     - Calculating exposures at each time step.
     - Computing PFE per trade by taking a specific percentile of positive exposures across simulated paths.
     - Optionally aggregating PFE profiles across trades.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - The file does not explicitly define any internal data structures. However, it mentions that input data is stored in JSON files within the `config/` directory.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - **Internal:** The file does not specify any internal dependencies on other modules or classes within the codebase.
   - **External:** No external libraries or packages are mentioned in this file.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - The file does not provide any information about error handling mechanisms or logging functionalities implemented in the project.

7. **Assumptions and Limitations (File-Specific):**
   - The file does not explicitly state any assumptions or limitations specific to its content. However, it is worth noting that as a README file, it provides a high-level overview and may not capture all the details and nuances of the project's implementation.
