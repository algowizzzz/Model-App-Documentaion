**1. Overall Purpose and Role:**
The primary purpose of this file is to provide a class for aggregating Potential Future Exposure (PFE) profiles across multiple trades. It serves as a component within a broader system or model for calculating and analyzing counterparty credit risk.

**2. Key Components and Functionality:**

- **TradeAggregator Class:**
    - **Purpose:** Manages the aggregation of PFE profiles across multiple trades.
    - **Key Operations:**
        - Stores individual trade PFE profiles in a dictionary.
        - Provides a method to retrieve all stored individual PFE profiles.
        - Implements a simple summation method to aggregate PFE profiles across trades.
    - **Inputs:**
        - `trade_id` (str): Unique identifier for a trade.
        - `pfe_profile` (numpy.ndarray): PFE profile for a specific trade.
    - **Outputs:**
        - `all_trade_pfe_profiles` (dict): Dictionary containing individual PFE profiles for each trade.
        - `aggregated_pfe_profile` (numpy.ndarray): Aggregated PFE profile across all trades (using the simple summation method).

**3. Core Algorithms and Logic (File-Specific):**
The core algorithm implemented in this file is the `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method of the `TradeAggregator` class. This method performs a simple summation of the PFE profiles across all trades by summing the PFE values at each time step. However, the method acknowledges that this approach is generally not how portfolio PFE is calculated due to netting effects, and it serves as a basic example rather than a production-ready implementation.

**4. Data Structures:**
The primary data structure used in this file is a dictionary (`all_trade_pfe_profiles`) to store individual PFE profiles for each trade, where the trade ID is the key, and the corresponding PFE profile (a numpy array) is the value.

**5. Dependencies:**

- **Internal:** None (assuming this is a standalone file).
- **External:**
    - `numpy`: Used for array operations and calculations on PFE profiles.

**6. Error Handling and Logging:**
- Error Handling:
    - The `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` method checks if the PFE profiles have different lengths and raises a `ValueError` if they do, as summing arrays of different lengths is not allowed.
- Logging:
    - The file uses `print` statements to log various events, such as the initialization of the `TradeAggregator` class, the addition of a new PFE profile, and the calculation of the aggregated PFE profile.

**7. Assumptions and Limitations (Strictly File-Specific):**
- Assumptions:
    - The input PFE profiles are provided as numpy arrays.
    - The PFE profiles for different trades have the same length (i.e., the same number of time steps).
- Limitations:
    - The simple summation method implemented in `calculate_simple_sum_pfe` is acknowledged as a basic example and not a production-ready implementation for calculating portfolio PFE due to the lack of netting effects consideration.
    - The file does not implement more complex aggregation methods, such as netting, which are typically required for accurate portfolio PFE calculation.
